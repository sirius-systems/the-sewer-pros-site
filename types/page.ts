/**
 * Structural page family. Drives template selection and internal linking.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * ⚠ RECONCILED FROM THREE DIVERGENT DOCUMENTED LISTS
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The source documents do not agree:
 *
 *   02 §26  has `resource-hub` and `legal`; lacks `contact`, `conversion`,
 *           and every hub type except resource-hub.
 *   19 §28  has `contact` and `conversion`; lacks `resource-hub` and
 *           `legal`.
 *   03 §52  has the fullest taxonomy, including Service Hub, Markets Hub,
 *           Audience Hub, Commercial Hub, Topic Hub.
 *
 * All three are explicitly provisional — 02 §26 says "Potential page
 * family types include" and "This list may evolve based on the final
 * information architecture"; 19 §28 says "Potential values"; 03 §52 says
 * "Final types should be represented consistently in the page build list
 * and code."
 *
 * Resolution applied here:
 *   - 02 §26 supplies the base, since it is already expressed as a TS
 *     type and governs code.
 *   - 03 §52 supplies the missing hub families. 02 §26 defers to the
 *     information architecture, and 03 IS that document. Doc 04's launch
 *     build needs them: /services/, /locations/, /for/, /commercial/,
 *     and /resources/ are all approved launch pages with no family in
 *     02 §26's list.
 *   - 19 §28's `contact` and `conversion` are NOT included. They are
 *     analytics attribution values, not structural families — /contact/
 *     is structurally `core`. See `AnalyticsPageType` below.
 *
 * ⚠ Recorded as DEC-066, status PROPOSED — not yet authoritative.
 * Confirm before page templates are built on it (build step 18).
 *
 * Families present in the 70-page launch build (04 §5):
 *   core (9) · service (10) · market (3) · location (16) ·
