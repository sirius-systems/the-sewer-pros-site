      answer: (
        <p>
          Visible conditions inside the accessible line: blockages, root
          intrusion, separated joints, cracks, offsets, standing water, and
          debris. It cannot guarantee detection of every hidden defect.
        </p>
      ),
    },
    {
      question: 'Do you do sewer repairs?',
      answer: (
        <p>
          No. We inspect, diagnose, locate, and clean. Where findings suggest
          work beyond cleaning, that is a conversation about the evidence,
          including having a qualified repair contractor review it.
        </p>
      ),
    },
    {
      question: 'My drain is slow. Does that mean the sewer line is damaged?',
      answer: (
        <p>
          Not necessarily. One slow fixture is often a local branch issue.
          Several fixtures draining slowly, or repeated backups, is more reason
          to look at the main line.
        </p>
      ),
    },
    {
      question: 'How much does a sewer inspection cost?',
      answer: (
        <p>
          Cost depends on the length and accessibility of the line, whether a
          cleanout is available, and the market you&rsquo;re in. We don&rsquo;t
          publish a flat rate because those factors vary by property. Contact us
          for an estimate specific to your line.

      ),
    },
    {
      question: 'Do you serve my area?',

        <p>
          We work across the St. Louis, San Diego, and Las Vegas metro areas as
          a service-area business: we travel to you rather than operating from a
          public storefront. Check our locations page for specific coverage.
        </p>
      ),
    },
    {
      question: 'What is the difference between an inspection and cleaning?',
      answer: (
        <p>
          An inspection documents the condition of the line with a camera.
          Cleaning removes what has accumulated inside it. They are often done
          together, but they answer different questions: inspection tells you
          what is wrong, cleaning restores flow.
        </p>
      ),
    },
    {
      question: 'Should I get a sewer inspection before buying a house?',
      answer: (
        <p>
          A sewer camera inspection before closing can reveal blockages, root
          intrusion, or pipe damage that a standard home inspection does not
          check. The Sewer Pros provides independent camera inspections for
          home buyers, with recorded video to support your decision.
        </p>
      ),
    },
    {
      question: 'What is a sewer scope, and is it the same as a camera inspection?',
      answer: (
        <p>
          A sewer scope is a video camera inspection of the sewer line,
          performed by pushing a specialized camera through the pipe. The terms
          are used interchangeably in the industry, and The Sewer Pros uses the
          same camera equipment and reporting for both.
        </p>
      ),
    },
    {
      question: 'Should I get a second opinion before agreeing to a sewer replacement?',
      answer: (
        <p>
          A second inspection can confirm whether a sewer line actually needs
          replacement or can be cleaned and maintained instead. The Sewer Pros
          performs independent camera inspections without an incentive to sell
          repair or replacement work, giving you an unbiased look at the
          pipe&rsquo;s condition.
        </p>
      ),
    },
    {
      question: 'What causes recurring sewer backups?',
      answer: (
        <p>
          Recurring backups are often caused by root intrusion, grease buildup,
          a pipe offset, or a partial blockage that returns after snaking. A
          camera inspection identifies the specific cause so the right next
          step, whether cleaning, hydro jetting, or further diagnosis, can be
          chosen.
        </p>
      ),
    },
    {
      question: 'What does sewer line locating involve, and when is it needed?',
      answer: (
        <p>
          Sewer line locating uses specialized equipment to trace the exact path
          and depth of an underground sewer line. It is typically needed before
          excavation or construction, or when a line&rsquo;s location is
          undocumented.
        </p>
      ),
    },
    {
      question: 'Is hydro jetting different from regular drain cleaning?',
      answer: (
        <p>
          Hydro jetting uses high-pressure water to clear grease, roots, and
          buildup from the full diameter of a pipe, while standard drain
          cleaning typically uses a cable to break through a single blockage.
          Hydro jetting reaches further and cleans more thoroughly for
          recurring or severe buildup.
        </p>
      ),
    },
    {
      question: 'Do you offer commercial sewer and drain services?',
      answer: (
        <p>
          The Sewer Pros provides commercial sewer camera inspection, cleaning,
          and hydro jetting for property managers, multi-family properties, and
          commercial facilities, with service available across St. Louis, San
          Diego, and Las Vegas.

        <h2>How these services fit together</h2>

          Most sewer problems are answered by some combination of three things:
          seeing the line, clearing it, and knowing where it runs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Inspection establishes condition. Cleaning removes what has
          accumulated. Locating establishes position and depth. Which you need
          depends on whether the question is what is wrong, how to restore
          flow, or where to dig.

          <p>
            Start with what you&rsquo;re trying to answer. If you want to know
            the condition of the line, start with inspection. If something
            isn&rsquo;t draining, cleaning usually comes first. If you need to
            know where the line runs before digging, that&rsquo;s locating.
            Several services often combine: cleaning before inspection is
            common, since buildup can hide what a camera would otherwise show.

      },
      {
        question: 'What is the difference between sewer cleaning and drain cleaning?',
        answer: (
          <p>
            Drain cleaning clears an individual fixture or branch line. Sewer
            cleaning clears the main line that carries everything away from the
            property. A single slow drain is usually a branch issue; several
            fixtures backing up at once more often points to the main line.

        <p>
          Sewer lines reflect where and when they were built. Housing age,
          common pipe materials, soil movement, root pressure from mature
          planting, and the rules of the local sewer authority all differ
          between markets, and all affect what tends to go wrong and what can
          be done about it.
        </p>
        <p>
          That is why market pages are worth writing properly rather than
          swapping a city name into the same paragraph, and why the ones here
          are being researched before they are published.

        <h2>Different decisions, different evidence</h2>
        <p>
          A homeowner with a recurring backup wants to know why it keeps
          happening. A buyer wants to know what they are taking on before
          committing. An agent wants a straight answer they can pass to a
          client without it becoming a sales process. A property manager wants
          to stop absorbing the same call every few months.
        </p>
        <p>
          The inspection is broadly the same work in each case. What differs is
          which findings matter, how urgently, and what decision they feed.
        </p>

        <h2>What is common to all of them</h2>
        <p>
          Everyone in that list benefits from the same thing: documented
          evidence of the line&rsquo;s condition, produced by a company that
          does not stand to gain from a particular interpretation of it.

      intro: (
        <p>
          A sewer and drain specialist focused on inspection, diagnostics,
          locating, and cleaning, deliberately not on repair.
        </p>
      ),
    },
    body: (
      <>
        <h2>What we do</h2>
        <p>
          We inspect sewer and drain lines with cameras, diagnose why lines
          block, locate where lines run, and clean them. That is the whole of
          it, and the boundary is intentional.
        </p>

        <h2>What we do not do</h2>
        <p>
          We do not perform sewer repair, replacement, lining, pipe bursting, or
          excavation. When an inspection turns up a condition that warrants
          structural work, the next conversation is with a qualified repair
          contractor, not with us.
        </p>

        <h2>Why that separation matters</h2>
        <p>
          Sewer findings are frequently ambiguous. A joint might be a
          maintenance item or the beginning of a failure; footage often supports
          more than one reading.
        </p>
        <p>
          A company that both diagnoses and sells the remedy is interpreting
          that ambiguity while standing to gain from one interpretation. That is
          a structural position, not a comment on anyone&rsquo;s integrity, but
          it is a position we chose not to occupy.
        </p>

        <h2>How we work</h2>
        <p>
          We put a camera in the line, document what is visible, and tell you
          what the footage supports. Where a line cannot be properly assessed,
          we say that rather than producing a confident conclusion the evidence
          does not carry.
        </p>
        <p>
          Where cleaning is likely to resolve the problem, we clean it. Where it
          is not, we will tell you that too.
        </p>

        <h2>The business</h2>
        <p>
          The Sewer Pros has operated since 2011, with over 100 years of
          combined experience across the team. We are locally owned and family
          operated.
        </p>
        <p>
          We work across the St. Louis area (St. Louis County, St. Charles
          County, Jefferson County and surrounding areas) and across San Diego
          County, which we have served since 2015. We are currently launching in
          the Las Vegas Valley.
        </p>

        <h2>Municipal lateral reporting</h2>
        <p>
          Many municipalities in the St. Louis area run sewer lateral repair
          programs, and most require documentation from a licensed plumber
          before they will consider a claim. We are licensed through most of
          those programs to submit reports.
        </p>
        <p>
          We document conditions; the municipality decides claims. We cannot
          promise an outcome, and any company that does is describing a
          decision that is not theirs to make.

            No. We inspect, diagnose, locate, and clean. Structural repair,

        question: 'Does the line need cleaning before it can be inspected?',
        answer: (
          <p>
            Sometimes. Heavy buildup or standing water can obscure the pipe
            wall. Where that prevents assessment, cleaning first produces
            footage that shows the pipe rather than what was sitting in it.

      },
      {
        question: 'Why does my line keep backing up after being cleared?',
        answer: (
          <p>
            Recurrence usually indicates something the clearing is not
            addressing: roots entering at a defect, a section holding water, or
            damage creating a catch point. That is a case for inspection rather
            than another clearing.

            No. They suit different problems, and jetting can be the wrong
            choice in a line that is already structurally compromised.

        ),
      },
      {
        question: 'Should I get a sewer inspection before buying a property?',
        answer: (
          <p>
            It is worth considering. The sewer line is underground and not
            visible without a camera, and a general property inspection does not
            usually include one.

          <p>
            No. Responsibility for portions of a sewer line varies by
            jurisdiction and is a question for the relevant authority or your
            own adviser. We document the condition of the line, not the legal
            position.

      <p>
        A useful sewer camera inspection report identifies the property and
        date, states where the camera entered the line and how far it
        travelled, describes each observed condition with its distance along
        the line, notes any section that could not be assessed and why, and
        includes the footage itself.
      </p>
    ),
    body: (
      <>
        <h2>Why the report matters as much as the inspection</h2>
        <p>
          The inspection produces evidence. The report is what makes that
          evidence usable later: when comparing quotes, revisiting a decision,
          or showing someone else what was found.
        </p>

        <h2>What a report should contain</h2>
        <h3>Identification</h3>
        <p>
          The property, the date, and which line was inspected. Obvious, and
          routinely omitted.
        </p>

        <h3>Access point and extent</h3>
        <p>
          Where the camera entered, and how far along the line it reached. The
          extent matters: a report covering thirty feet of a longer line is not
          a report on the whole line.
        </p>

        <h3>Observations with distances</h3>
        <p>
          Each condition should be tied to a distance along the line. &ldquo;Root
          intrusion at a joint&rdquo; is an observation; &ldquo;root intrusion
          at a joint approximately 42 feet from the cleanout&rdquo; is
          actionable: it can be located, quoted against, and re-checked.
        </p>

        <h3>What could not be assessed</h3>
        <p>
          Sections obscured by standing water or buildup, points where the
          camera could not pass, and any part of the line not reached. This is
          the section most often missing and among the most important: it
          tells you the limits of what the inspection established.
        </p>

        <h3>The footage</h3>
        <p>
          You should be able to keep a copy. It is evidence about your property.
        </p>

        <h2>What a report should not do</h2>
        <p>
          It should not assert conditions the camera cannot establish: pipe
          wall thickness from outside, soil conditions, or the remaining life of
          a line. It also should not present a repair recommendation as a
          finding; what was observed and what someone concludes from it are
          different things, and worth being able to separate.
        </p>

        <h2>Questions worth asking</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>How far along the line did you get, and what stopped you?</li>
          <li>Which sections could you not assess clearly?</li>
          <li>At what distance is each condition you noted?</li>
          <li>Was the line cleaned before this inspection?</li>
          <li>Can I have a copy of the footage?</li>

    faq: [

        question: 'Should the report include a repair quote?',
        answer: (
          <p>
            It can, but the observations and the recommendation should be
            distinguishable. Being able to separate what was seen from what
            someone proposes doing about it is what makes a second opinion
            possible.

      <p>
        Watch for four things: standing water where the line should drain,
        joints that are separated or misaligned, roots or material entering the
        pipe, and any change in the pipe&rsquo;s shape or surface. Note the
        distance counter when you see them: position is what makes an
        observation useful.

        <h2>What you are looking at</h2>
        <p>
          The camera travels along the inside of the pipe, lit from the head.
          The picture is close, wide-angle, and often wet, which is why
          footage can look alarming when it is normal, and normal when it is
          not.
        </p>

        <h2>Standing water</h2>
        <p>
          A line should carry water away. Water sitting in a section suggests
          that part of the line is not draining: a low spot, a loss of slope,
          or a restriction downstream. Watch whether the camera passes through
          water and out the other side, or whether it stays submerged.

        <h2>Joints</h2>
        <p>
          Joints appear as regular seams. What matters is whether they line up.
          A visible gap, a step where one section sits higher than the next, or
          daylight-like darkness at a seam suggests separation or offset, and
          those are the points where roots and material typically enter.
        </p>

        <h2>Roots and intrusion</h2>
        <p>
          Roots enter at defects, so their presence marks the defect. Fine
          hair-like growth and heavier mass differ in severity but both indicate
          an opening. Note where along the line they appear.
        </p>

        <h2>Changes in the pipe itself</h2>
        <p>
          Watch for the pipe changing material or diameter, scale or buildup
          coating the wall, cracks, and any point where the round profile
          deforms. A change of material is not itself a problem: it is
          information about how the line was built or previously worked on.
        </p>

        <h2>The distance counter</h2>
        <p>
          Most footage displays distance. It is the single most useful thing on
          screen: an observation with a distance can be located on the property,
          quoted against precisely, and compared to a later inspection.
        </p>

        <h2>What footage cannot tell you</h2>
        <p>
          It shows the inside surface of the accessible line, at that moment.
          It does not show wall thickness, the ground around the pipe, or how
          long a condition has existed. Obscured sections are unknown, not
          fine, and treating them as fine is the most common misreading.
        </p>

        <h2>If you are unsure</h2>
        <p>
          Ask whoever inspected the line to talk you through the footage against
          the distances. If the reading matters to a significant decision,
          getting a second view of the same footage is reasonable.

        question: 'The video looks bad. Does that mean the line is failing?',
        answer: (
          <p>
            Not necessarily. Sewer footage frequently looks worse than the
            condition warrants: the camera is close, the environment is wet,
            and normal wear reads dramatically. What matters is specific
            observations at specific distances, not the general impression.
