 *
 * ===========================================================================
 * INDEXATION GATE RELEASED — DEC-080
 * ===========================================================================
 * All five pages carry `status: 'launch'` and `indexable: true`. They
 * appear in the sitemap, in navigation, and in indexable link modules
 * automatically, because those systems read the approved page registry
 * rather than a hardcoded market list.
 *
 * DEC-063 held these pages back until its eight release criteria were
 * satisfied. DEC-080 (2026-08-17) records that they are, and promoted
 * the five records.
 *
 * ⚠ Criterion 7 — Nevada licensing — is satisfied by the owner's
 * PRIVATE confirmation, recorded in `22-decisions-change-log.md` only.
 * No licensing claim appears on any page, and none should be added.
 * DEC-072's stance is unchanged: licence numbers are not published.
 * The confirmation lives in governance; it is not site copy.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * ⚠ "OPERATIONAL", NEVER "ESTABLISHED"
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The owner updated Las Vegas from "currently launching" to
 * "operational" on 2026-08-17 (DEC-074). The copy reflects that.
 *
 * Releasing the gate does NOT license a track record, and this is the
 * easiest thing to get wrong now that the pages are indexed. 01 §20
 * forbids importing another market's facts — St. Louis's 2011 founding
 * and San Diego's 2015 stay where they belong — so no page below claims
 * years of local service, local volume, review counts, or a local
 * office. Indexation changes who sees these pages, not what the
 * business can say on them.
 *
 * The SERVICE MENU is confirmed. DEC-076 (2026-08-17) supersedes
 * DEC-075's 13 of 18: Las Vegas matches San Diego at 17 of 18, the
 * eighteenth being St. Louis lateral reporting, which is
 * `not_applicable` here rather than a gap. No page cites a count.
 *
 * ⚠ Four commercial services remain `capability_validate_packaging` in
 * EVERY market, Las Vegas included, so commercial packaging still must
 * not be presented as an established offering (06 §43).
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHY THE HOUSING ANGLE IS ABSENT HERE
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * This is the newest housing of the three markets by a wide margin —
 * even the oldest of the four locations is roughly 13% pre-1970. The
 * "aging pipe" framing that carries St. Louis has almost no purchase.
 *
 * Median years are cited where they support an argument about what
 * actually fails on newer lines, and nowhere as a risk signal.

      <h2>Who governs your sewer here depends on where you live</h2>
      <p>
        The Las Vegas Valley has no single sewer authority. Each incorporated
        city runs its own utility relationship, while the Clark County Water
        Reclamation District, publicly branded the Clean Water Team, serves
        the unincorporated areas of the valley.
      </p>
      <p>
        That fragmentation is not administrative trivia. Which authority
        governs your address determines who to contact, what rules apply, and
        whether any assistance exists. Summerlin is the clearest illustration:
        it genuinely straddles two authorities depending on which side of an
        incorporation line a property sits on.
      </p>

      <h2>The lateral is the property owner&rsquo;s</h2>
      <p>
        The Clark County Water Reclamation District states it directly: a
        damaged sewer lateral connecting a house to the sewer main in the street
        is the responsibility of the property owner: cleaning, repair, and
        replacement alike.
      </p>
      <p>
        Henderson is equally explicit. The city states that homeowner
        responsibility begins where the lateral connects to the city&rsquo;s
        sewer main in the street, and that the owner must maintain and repair
        from that point through the home&rsquo;s plumbing, bearing the cost.
      </p>

      <h2>Assistance here means insurance you buy, not a fund</h2>
      <p>
        This is a genuine difference from other markets. Rather than a
        reimbursement programme, the City of Las Vegas partners with a private
        company on an <strong>optional paid warranty</strong>: Service Line
        Warranties of America, at $6.00 per month or $67.00 per year, with no
        coverage cap and no deductible or service fee.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is a product a homeowner chooses to buy, not a municipal fund that
        contributes toward an eligible repair. Whether it is worth buying
        depends on the condition of the line you actually have, which is a
        question that can be answered rather than guessed at.
      </p>

      <h2>Newer housing, different failure modes</h2>
      <p>
        The Las Vegas Valley has among the newest housing of anywhere we work.
        Most laterals here will be PVC rather than clay, cast iron, or
        bituminized fibre, which removes the material decay that dominates older
        regions.
      </p>
      <p>
        What it does not remove is ground movement. On newer lines the recurring
        findings are bellies holding standing water, joints opened by
        settlement, and damage from later construction or landscaping, all of
        which produce the same repeating slow-drainage pattern people associate
        with old pipe, from an entirely different cause.

        <h2>An optional warranty, not a reimbursement programme</h2>
        <p>
          The City of Las Vegas partners with Service Line Warranties of America
          on an optional paid warranty covering sewer lateral repair: $6.00 per
          month or $67.00 per year, with no coverage cap and no deductible or
          service fee.
        </p>
        <p>
          The distinction from other regions matters. This is insurance the
          homeowner elects to buy in advance. It is not a municipal fund that
          contributes toward an eligible repair after a failure, and there is no
          equivalent free programme.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether the product is worth it depends on the line you actually have.
          A recently laid PVC lateral in sound condition and a line with a known
          defect are different propositions, and the difference is establishable.
        </p>

        <h2>Confirm the responsibility boundary with the city</h2>
        <p>
          Sewer service in the city is handled by City of Las Vegas Public Works,
          through its Water Pollution Control division. We have not located an
          explicit published statement from the city setting out exactly where
          homeowner responsibility for the lateral begins and ends.
        </p>
        <p>
          The existence of the warranty product strongly implies the standard
          model (the homeowner owns the lateral), which is what every other
          authority in the valley states. But rather than assert the
          city&rsquo;s policy from an inference, confirm it with{' '}
          <a href="https://www.lasvegasnevada.gov/Government/Departments/Public-Works">
            City of Las Vegas Public Works
          </a>
          .
        </p>

        <h2>What actually fails on Las Vegas lines</h2>
        <p>
          The city&rsquo;s housing has a median year built of around 1994
          (American Community Survey, 2019&ndash;2023 five-year estimates), with
          close to 28% of all housing built during the 1990s alone.
        </p>
        <p>
          That means most laterals here are PVC. Material decay, the clay joints
          and corroded cast iron that dominate older regions, is largely not
          the issue. What is:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Bellies where a section lost slope and holds standing water</li>
          <li>Joints opened by ground movement rather than age</li>
          <li>Damage from later landscaping, pools, or construction</li>
          <li>Roots entering wherever movement created an opening</li>

    faq: [

        question: 'Should I buy the city’s warranty?',
        answer: (
          <p>
            That depends on the condition of your line, which is worth
            establishing either way. The warranty is $6.00 a month or $67.00 a
            year with no cap and no deductible, but it is a product you buy,
            not assistance you claim after a failure.

        <h2>Henderson states the boundary precisely</h2>
        <p>
          The City of Henderson&rsquo;s Department of Utility Services is more
          explicit than most authorities manage: homeowner responsibility begins
          at the point where the lateral connects to the city&rsquo;s sewer main
          in the street. From that point through the home&rsquo;s plumbing, the
          owner must maintain and repair, bearing the cost.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is no ambiguity to work around here, and no assistance programme
          was found to offset it. The full run from the street connection
          inward is yours.
        </p>
        <p>
          The city&rsquo;s page describes billing and customer service rather
          than the treatment relationship, so if you need to know how
          Henderson&rsquo;s wastewater treatment relates to the county district,
          check{' '}
          <a href="https://www.cityofhenderson.com/government/departments/utility-services/customer-care-center/water-and-sewer-laterals">

          directly.
        </p>

        <h2>Very new housing, and what that changes</h2>
        <p>
          Henderson&rsquo;s median year built is around 2001 (American Community
          Survey, 2019&ndash;2023 five-year estimates), with more than 60% of
          all housing built between 1990 and 2009. Roughly 3% predates 1970.
        </p>
        <p>
          Almost every lateral here will be PVC. That is genuinely good news
          about material failure, and it is why the &ldquo;old pipe&rdquo;
          framing common in sewer marketing does not describe Henderson.
        </p>

        <h2>What still goes wrong</h2>
        <p>
          Newer pipe does not float above the ground it sits in. On lines of
          this era the recurring findings are bellies holding water, joints
          opened by settlement, and damage from work done after the line was
          laid: pools, additions, landscaping, utility trenching.
        </p>
        <p>
          A belly produces exactly the symptom people read as an ageing sewer:
          drainage that slows, gets cleared, and slows again on a cycle. The
          cause is different, and clearing it repeatedly does not address it.

        </p>
        <p>
          Practically every lateral here will be PVC, laid within the last
          twenty-five years. Material decay is not the story in North Las Vegas,
          and any pitch built on deteriorating old pipe does not describe this
          city.
        </p>

        <h2>What a rapid-growth era leaves behind</h2>
        <p>
          Housing built quickly and recently has its own characteristic issues,
          and they are about the ground rather than the pipe:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Bellies.</strong> A section that settled and lost slope
            holds standing water, and solids drop out wherever flow slows.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Joint separation from movement.</strong> PVC joints are
            sound until the ground shifts around them.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Damage from later work.</strong> Pools, additions,
            landscaping, and utility trenching all cross laterals, and the
            damage often does not surface immediately.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          All three produce recurring slow drainage that clears and returns:
          the symptom people attribute to an old sewer, on a line that is
          nothing of the sort.
        </p>

        <h2>Summerlin sits across a jurisdictional line</h2>
        <p>
          This is the fact worth knowing before you contact anyone about a sewer
          problem in Summerlin, and it surprises people who have lived here for
          years.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most of Summerlin lies within the incorporated City of Las Vegas,
          roughly 22,500 acres along the city&rsquo;s western edge. But
          Summerlin South is a separate unincorporated Clark County
          census-designated place, not part of the city at all, and falls under
          the Clark County Water Reclamation District instead.
        </p>
        <p>
          Two properties a short distance apart can therefore sit under
          different authorities, with different points of contact and different
          rules. The City of Las Vegas&rsquo;s optional warranty product, for
          instance, applies only to the incorporated portion.
        </p>

        <h2>Find out which side you are on</h2>
        <p>
          Because the boundary is not visible from the street and not obvious
          from an address, confirm it rather than assume. Clark County publishes
          a{' '}
          <a href="https://www.clarkcountynv.gov/assets/documents/residents/about_clark_county/map-jurisdictional-boundaries-0124.pdf">
            jurisdictional boundary map
          </a>{' '}
          showing where incorporated city limits end.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is worth five minutes. Contacting the wrong authority about a sewer
          problem wastes time you may not have.
        </p>

        <h2>Either way, the lateral is yours</h2>
        <p>
          The one thing that does not change across the boundary is
          responsibility. The Clark County Water Reclamation District states
          that a damaged lateral connecting a house to the main in the street is
          the property owner&rsquo;s: cleaning, repair, and replacement.
        </p>

        <h2>A tightly concentrated construction era</h2>
        <p>
          Summerlin&rsquo;s housing is unusually concentrated: a median year
          built of around 1992, with 51.4% of all housing built during the 1990s
          alone (American Community Survey, 2019&ndash;2023 five-year
          estimates, covering ZIP codes 89128 and 89145).
        </p>
        <p>
          A community built largely within one decade tends to reach the same
          stage of ground settlement at broadly the same time. That makes
          bellies and settlement-opened joints the findings to expect here,
          rather than the material decay of an older region.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that figure describes incorporated Summerlin rather than
          Summerlin South, which is a separate geography, another reason the
          boundary is worth confirming.

        answer: (
          <p>
            Mostly, but not entirely. Most of Summerlin is within incorporated
            city limits, while Summerlin South is unincorporated Clark County
            and falls under the county water reclamation district. Check Clark
            County&rsquo;s jurisdictional boundary map for your address.

            Only if your property is in the incorporated portion. The City of
            Las Vegas&rsquo;s optional warranty does not extend to unincorporated
            Summerlin South.
