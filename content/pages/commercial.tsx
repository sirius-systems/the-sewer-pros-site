        <h2>Why inspection matters differently on a commercial property</h2>
        <p>
          On a commercial property, a sewer failure interrupts trading,
          displaces tenants, or closes a kitchen. The cost is rarely limited to
          the plumbing, which changes the value of knowing a line&rsquo;s
          condition before it fails rather than after.
        </p>
        <p>
          Inspection also produces something a verbal assessment does not: a
          record. That matters when a decision has to be justified to an owner,
          a board, a tenant, or an insurer.
        </p>

        <h2>Common reasons for a commercial inspection</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Establishing baseline condition across a property or portfolio</li>
          <li>Investigating recurring blockages affecting operations</li>
          <li>Supporting a planned-maintenance decision with evidence</li>
          <li>Understanding a line before committing to major work</li>
          <li>Documenting condition at a change of tenancy or ownership</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Working around operations</h2>
        <p>
          Access on a commercial site usually involves more than opening a
          cleanout: occupied units, trading hours, service corridors, and other
          contractors on site. Inspection work is planned around that rather
          than assuming an empty building.
        </p>

        <h2>What the inspection does not establish</h2>
        <p>
          The same limits apply as on any line: a camera shows visible,
          accessible conditions. It cannot guarantee detection of every hidden
          defect, and where buildup or standing water prevents assessment, that
          is reported rather than worked around.

            to us about what the site requires.

          Clearing accumulated material from commercial sewer lines, where

        <h2>What differs on a commercial line</h2>
        <p>
          Commercial lines typically carry more volume, more continuously, and
          often more grease and solids than a residential line. Accumulation
          happens faster, which means the interval between a line being clear
          and a line being a problem is shorter.
        </p>

        <h2>The operational cost of a backup</h2>
        <p>
          A blocked line in an occupied building is not only a plumbing
          problem. It can close facilities, interrupt service, affect tenants,
          and require notifying people who will ask what is being done about it.
        </p>
        <p>
          That is why commercial cleaning is more often planned than reactive,
          and why knowing which lines actually need attention matters more than
          servicing everything on a default schedule.
        </p>

        <h2>Cleaning and knowing why</h2>
        <p>
          A line that blocks repeatedly is telling you something. Cleaning it
          again manages the symptom; inspecting it establishes whether the cause
          is ordinary accumulation or a defect that will keep producing
          blockages regardless of how often the line is cleared.

        <p>
          High-pressure cleaning for lines carrying grease, solids, and
          continuous volume, where buildup on the pipe wall, not a single
          obstruction, is the recurring problem.
        </p>
      ),
    },
    body: (
      <>
        <h2>Why jetting appears more often on commercial lines</h2>
        <p>
          Food-service and high-volume lines accumulate on the pipe wall rather
          than blocking at a single point. Clearing a channel through that
          accumulation restores flow briefly; removing material from the full
          circumference lasts longer.
        </p>

        <h2>Grease, scale, and sludge</h2>
        <p>
          Grease is the recurring commercial case: it cools, adheres, and
          narrows the line progressively. Scale and sludge behave similarly in
          lines carrying heavy or continuous flow. All three respond to jetting
          in a way that mechanical clearing addresses less completely.
        </p>

        <h2>When jetting is not the right call</h2>
        <p>
          The same caution applies as on any line, and commercial properties
          often have older infrastructure where it matters more. High-pressure
          water in a line that is already structurally compromised can worsen
          the problem.
        </p>
        <p>
          Where a line&rsquo;s condition is unknown, establishing it first is
          part of doing the work properly rather than an upsell.

        question: 'How often do grease-bearing lines need jetting?',
        answer: (
          <p>
            It depends on volume, what enters the line, and its condition, not
            on a standard interval. Establishing the rate of accumulation for a
            specific line is more useful than applying a default.

        <h2>Many fixtures, shared lines</h2>
        <p>
          Commercial properties concentrate fixtures: multiple restrooms,
          kitchens, floor drains, and shared branch lines serving several
          units. That concentration makes the pattern of which drains are
          affected genuinely diagnostic.
        </p>
        <p>
          One fixture is usually a branch problem. A pattern across units,
          floors, or the lowest fixtures in the building points further
          downstream.
        </p>

        <h2>Why the distinction matters operationally</h2>
        <p>
          Clearing individual fixtures repeatedly across a property is a
          recurring cost and a recurring disruption. If the cause is in a shared
          line, each of those visits is treating a symptom in a different place.
        </p>

        <h2>Multi-unit coordination</h2>
        <p>
          Work in occupied units means access arrangements, notice, and timing
          that suits tenants rather than only the schedule. That is a planning
          question as much as a plumbing one.

    body: (

        <h2>Planned versus reactive</h2>
        <p>
          A reactive model waits for a backup and absorbs whatever disruption
          it causes. A planned model services lines with a known reason to need
          it, at a time that suits operations.
        </p>
        <p>
          The difference is largely about when the disruption happens and how
          much of it there is, not about whether lines need attention.
        </p>

        <h2>Which lines actually warrant it</h2>
        <p>
          Not every line on a property needs scheduled service. The ones that
          usually do are those carrying grease or heavy volume, those with a
          history of blockages, and those where failure would close something.
        </p>
        <p>
          Establishing which is which starts with inspection. A schedule set
          without knowing the condition of the lines is a guess with an invoice
          attached.
        </p>

        <h2>Documentation</h2>
        <p>
          Recurring service produces a record of condition over time, useful
          when justifying budget, planning capital work, or demonstrating that a
          known issue was being managed.
        </p>

        <h2>What we will tell you</h2>
        <p>
          If the evidence does not support servicing a line on an interval, we
          will say so. Recommending maintenance that the line&rsquo;s condition
          does not justify would be the same repair-driven behaviour the
          business exists to avoid.
