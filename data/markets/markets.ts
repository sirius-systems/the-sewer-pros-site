 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHAT THIS FILE DOES NOT CONTAIN
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Service availability is NOT stored here. It lives per-service,
 * per-market in the service registry (`markets` field, doc 06 §7) and
 * is derived via `isServiceAvailableInMarket()`.
 *
 * Duplicating it would create a second source of truth that silently
 * drifts, and 06 §9 makes the service registry authoritative. The
 * derivation helper arrives with the service registry loader (step 10).
 *
 * Index status is likewise NOT stored here. All three market hubs carry
 * `index_status: 'launch'` in the location registry, but doc 04 gates
 * `/las-vegas-nv/` as `launch_pending_validation` (DEC-063). Page
 * authorisation belongs to the approved page registry (step 12), not
 * to this file.

/**
 * The three approved markets.
 *
 * Names and slugs are taken from the market hub records in
 * `data/locations/master-location-registry.json`, which is the
 * geography authority (07). Do not retype them from memory.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * PHONES YES, ADDRESSES NO
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * St. Louis and San Diego each publish a phone number on their own site
 * (DEC-070, DEC-071). Las Vegas publishes none.
 *
 * NO market has a published street address, so `physicalLocation` is
 * absent from all three (01 §35, 15 §102-103).
 *
 * St. Louis is the case worth stating explicitly: it HAS an existing
 * Google Business Profile (01 §21), and that still does not authorise
 * publishing an address. 15 §11: "The GBP itself does not authorize
 * inventing or exposing an address that has not been approved for
 * website publication." PENDING-002 covers the verified details.
 *
 * Consequence: `permitsLocalBusinessEntity()` returns false for all
 * three markets. There is currently no `LocalBusiness` schema entity
 * anywhere on the site. Markets are represented as `Place` +
 * `Service.areaServed` (15 §13).
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * ⚠ PER-MARKET CONTACT IS NOT A FORMALITY HERE
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * St. Louis and San Diego publish SEPARATE sites with different phone
 * numbers, different hours, and different founding years (DEC-070,
 * DEC-071). That is exactly the situation 01 §20 anticipates in
 * forbidding business facts from being copied between markets, and
 * 02 §55 in calling for market-specific contact data.
 *
 * Showing the St. Louis number on a San Diego page would be wrong, not
 * merely imprecise.
