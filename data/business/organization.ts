 * Verified business facts.
 *
 * Authority: docs/01-business-brand-foundation.md §2, §3, §21, §22, §35, §36
 *            docs/02-nextjs-technical-architecture.md §54
 *            docs/15-schema-entity-strategy.md §8, §102, §103
 *
 * ===========================================================================
 * ⚠  EVERY VALUE HERE MUST BE A VERIFIED FACT
 * ===========================================================================
 * This is the single source for business information across the site
 * (02 §54: "Do not hard-code phone numbers or addresses into dozens of
 * components").
 *
 * That makes it the highest-risk file in the repository. A fabricated
 * value added here does not stay here — it propagates into schema,
 * metadata, page copy, and forms at once.
 *
 * The rule when a fact is unknown is OMISSION, not a placeholder
 * (15 §102-103, 01 §35, CLAUDE.md §23, §100):
 *
 *   correct    field absent
 *   WRONG      phone: '000-000-0000'
 *   WRONG      phone: 'TBD'
 *   WRONG      phone: ''
 *   WRONG      a plausible-looking invented number
 *
 * A smaller accurate object beats a larger inaccurate one (15 §103).
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * SOURCED FROM THE BUSINESS'S OWN PUBLISHED SITE (DEC-070)
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The contact, founding, and affiliation facts below come from
 * thesewerpros.com — the business publishing them about itself. Under
 * 01 §24 that makes them Confirmed Business Facts rather than
 * inference, which is what distinguishes them from the placeholders
 * this file previously refused to invent.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * STILL ABSENT, AND WHY
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * No address        — not published anywhere on the business's own site.
 *                     PENDING-002 remains open, and 15 §11 is explicit
 *                     that the existing St. Louis GBP does NOT authorize
 *                     publishing one. `permitsLocalBusinessEntity()`
 *                     therefore still returns false for every market.
 * No licence number — not published on the business's site.
 * No geo            — 15 §79; never approximate.
 * No ratings,       — 01 §35. Still undocumented.
 *    review counts
 * No sameAs         — 01 §22 records San Diego social presence but gives
 *                     no URLs, and 15 §27 requires each profile be
 *                     verified as official and controlled before
 *                     linking. Follower counts are not URLs.
 * No logo           — no asset provided.
 * No knowsAbout     — schema layer (step 15), derived from the service
 *                     registry rather than hand-listed (15 §69, §91).
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * ⚠ THREE CLAIMS ARE APPROVED BUT MARKET-SCOPED (DEC-072)
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The owner approved republication of "#1 choice in St. Louis", "over
 * 100 years of combined experience", and "over 100,000 camera
 * inspections completed".
 *
 * Permission is not the constraint; SCOPE is. Two of the three are
 * St. Louis site claims, and 01 §20 forbids carrying one market's facts
 * into another — so they must never appear on a San Diego or Las Vegas
 * page. See `MARKET_SCOPED_CLAIMS` below.
 *
 * The superlative also remains unsubstantiated by any third party.
 * 18 §71 treats that as challengeable on an authority platform; the
 * owner's decision and the reasoning are recorded in DEC-072.
