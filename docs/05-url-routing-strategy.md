**Document:** `05-url-routing-strategy.md`
**Project:** The Sewer Pros Website Rebuild
**Repository:** `the-sewer-pros-site`
**Status:** Active Routing Authority
**Document Role:** Canonical URL, slug, route-family, redirect, and route-generation source of truth

# 1. Purpose

This document defines the canonical URL and application-routing strategy for The Sewer Pros website.

It governs:

* URL structure
* path hierarchy
* canonical paths
* market routing
* location routing
* service routing
* service + location routing
* audience routing
* commercial routing
* comparison pages
* alternative pages
* resource pages
* slug normalization
* trailing-slash behavior
* route collisions
* aliases
* redirect behavior
* legacy URL migration
* Next.js App Router implementation
* static route generation
* sitemap consistency

This document answers:

> **When a page is developed, what stable pathname should it use—and when it is published, what is its one canonical production URL?**

---

# 2. Governing Document Relationship

The project source-of-truth hierarchy for routing is:

```text
03-information-architecture.md
↓
Defines how pages relate conceptually

04-master-page-build-list.md
↓
Tracks page lifecycle, production publication, and indexation state

05-url-routing-strategy.md
↓
Defines the stable pathname pattern and production canonical route

06-master-service-registry.md
+
07-master-location-registry.md
↓
Provide canonical service/location identifiers and slugs

Next.js Route Registry
↓
Implements environment-filtered development, preview, and production routes
```

A production route must not exist simply because its pathname can be calculated. A candidate pathname may be generated and registered for development or protected preview without becoming public, canonical, or indexable.

---

# 2A. Build-First Routing Model

Routing must support implementation without turning every development route into a production URL.

The route registry should distinguish:

```text
CANDIDATE / DRAFT
May be generated, built, and reviewed locally or in a protected preview.

BUILD-READY
Has the content and dependencies needed for implementation or QA.

PUBLISHED
Is deliberately included in the production route collection.

INDEXABLE / NOINDEX
Controls search exposure separately from publication.

DEFERRED / RETIRED
Remains outside active production generation unless its documented state changes.
```

The exact status field names must match `04-master-page-build-list.md`. This document defines routing behavior, not a competing status vocabulary.

Service, location, audience, commercial, and opportunity data may support candidate-route generation in bounded development workflows. They must not automatically populate the production route collection.

Pre-build permission gates must not be added to pathname helpers, route registries, `generateStaticParams()`, CI, or validation. These systems should validate route integrity and filter environment exposure—not prevent legitimate components, drafts, or candidate routes from being created.

---

# 3. Core URL Principle

Every indexable page should have:

* one primary search intent
* one canonical pathname
* one canonical URL
* one stable page ID

Avoid multiple URLs representing the same entity or intent.

The governing principle is:

```text
One Page
→
One Canonical Path
→
One Canonical URL
```

---

# 4. Canonical URL Style

Canonical URLs should be:

* lowercase
* human-readable
* descriptive
* concise
* hyphen-separated
* stable
* keyword-relevant without being keyword-stuffed
* logically grouped by page family
* free from unnecessary parameters

Preferred:

```text
/services/sewer-camera-inspection/
```

Avoid:

```text
/services/SewerCameraInspection/
/service?id=3289
/sewer-camera-inspection-service-company-professional/
/services/sewer_camera_inspection/
```

---

# 5. Trailing-Slash Standard

The project will use:

```ts
trailingSlash: true
```

Canonical URLs therefore end with `/`.

Examples:

```text
/services/sewer-camera-inspection/

/st-louis-mo/chesterfield/

/san-diego-ca/carlsbad/sewer-camera-inspection/
```

Next.js supports configuring trailing-slash normalization through the `trailingSlash` setting.

This routing document therefore **finalizes the project-specific trailing-slash decision**.

The earlier example in:

`02-nextjs-technical-architecture.md`

showing:

```ts
trailingSlash: false
```

was illustrative rather than final.

For this project, the authoritative setting is:

```ts
trailingSlash: true
```

This decision should later be recorded in:

`22-decisions-change-log.md`

---

# 6. Recommended Next.js Configuration

The relevant routing portion of `next.config.ts` should conceptually resemble:

```ts
import type { NextConfig } from 'next'

const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
  output: 'export',

  trailingSlash: true,

  images: {
    unoptimized: true,
  },
}

export default nextConfig
```

The project remains static-export-first.

Next.js static export generates static output for prebuilt routes, while `generateStaticParams()` can provide an environment-filtered parameter set for dynamic App Router segments. Development or protected-preview builds may include registered candidates; production builds must include only the deliberately published route collection.

---

# 7. Canonical URL Origin

The production origin should be centralized through configuration.

Example:

```ts
export const siteConfig = {
  siteUrl: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL,
}
```

Canonical URL generation should conceptually use:

```ts
new URL(pathname, siteConfig.siteUrl)
```

Do not manually type the production domain into:

* individual pages
* schema
* sitemap records
* breadcrumbs
* Open Graph metadata

The final production-domain decision will be confirmed through the migration plan.

---

# 8. Global Route Families

The supported route families are:

```text
/
```

```text
/about/
/contact/
/faq/
```

```text
/services/
/services/{service}/
```

```text
/locations/
```

```text
/{market}/
/{market}/{location-path}/
/{market}/{location-path}/{service}/
```

```text
/{market}/{market-specific-service}/
```

```text
/for/
/for/{audience}/
```

```text
/{market}/{location-path}/for/{audience}/
```

```text
/commercial/
/commercial/{service}/
```

```text
/{market}/{location-path}/commercial/{service}/
```

```text
/compare/{comparison}/
```

```text
/alternatives/{alternative}/
```

```text
/resources/
/resources/{resource}/
```

Future resource topic hubs may be modeled and developed within this pattern. They enter the production route collection only when selected in the Master Page Build List.

---

# 9. Global Reserved Segments

The following root-level path segments are reserved:

```text
about
contact
faq
services
locations
for
commercial
compare
alternatives
resources
```

Future reserved terms may include:

```text
privacy
terms
accessibility
reviews
```

if those pages are selected for production.

No market ID, service alias, or other entity may use a root slug that conflicts with a reserved segment.

---

# 10. Market Route Pattern

Each primary market receives one canonical market hub.

Pattern:

```text
/{market}/
```

Approved market slugs:

```text
st-louis-mo
san-diego-ca
las-vegas-nv
```

Result:

```text
/st-louis-mo/
/san-diego-ca/
/las-vegas-nv/
```

These market IDs should remain stable even if visible marketing terminology changes.

---

# 11. Market Slug Standard

Primary market slugs should generally use:

```text
city-state-abbreviation
```

Examples:

```text
st-louis-mo
san-diego-ca
las-vegas-nv
```

This makes geographic identity explicit and reduces ambiguity.

Future markets should follow the same model where practical.

---

# 12. Market Hub vs City Page

A market hub may represent a broader operating geography than its similarly named city.

Therefore:

```text
/san-diego-ca/
```

and:

```text
/san-diego-ca/san-diego/
```

are separate entities.

Likewise:

```text
/las-vegas-nv/
```

and:

```text
/las-vegas-nv/las-vegas/
```

serve different architectural purposes.

### Market Hub

```text
/san-diego-ca/
```

Represents the entire San Diego operating market.

### City Page

```text
/san-diego-ca/san-diego/
```

Represents service intent specifically associated with the City of San Diego.

Do not automatically redirect the city page into the market hub unless future search/cannibalization analysis determines they should be consolidated.

---

# 13. St. Louis Market Distinction

The St. Louis architecture uses:

```text
/st-louis-mo/
```

for the broader market.

The independent-city geography is:

```text
/st-louis-mo/st-louis-city/
```

This prevents ambiguity between:

* St. Louis metropolitan market
* St. Louis City
* St. Louis County
* individual municipalities

---

# 14. Location Route Pattern

The standard location pattern is:

```text
/{market}/{location}/
```

Examples:

```text
/st-louis-mo/chesterfield/
/san-diego-ca/carlsbad/
/las-vegas-nv/henderson/
```

The location slug must come from the canonical location registry.

Do not independently regenerate location slugs inside page components.

---

# 15. Canonical Location Path Is Authoritative

Every canonical location record should have a stable pathname value or pathname input stored in the location registry. That value may support development before a standalone location page is published.

Example:

```ts
{
  id: 'loc-carlsbad',
  name: 'Carlsbad',
  marketId: 'san-diego-ca',
  slug: 'carlsbad',
  pathname: '/san-diego-ca/carlsbad/',
}
```

The pathname should be treated as the authoritative route representation.

---

# 16. Nested Geographic Routes

Some geographic entities require deeper hierarchy.

The primary example is St. Louis City neighborhoods.

Pattern:

```text
/st-louis-mo/st-louis-city/{neighborhood}/
```

Examples:

```text
/st-louis-mo/st-louis-city/soulard/
/st-louis-mo/st-louis-city/the-hill/
/st-louis-mo/st-louis-city/tower-grove-south/
```

These routes may be developed as registered candidates, but they should enter the production route collection only when selected by the Master Page Build List.

Neighborhood status in the geographic registry alone does not authorize publication or indexation.

---

# 17. Append-to-Canonical-Location Rule

For location-specific page families, the system should not assume that every location has exactly one segment.

Instead:

> **Start with the canonical pathname of the location and append the required child segment.**

Example location:

```text
/st-louis-mo/st-louis-city/soulard/
```

Service + location:

```text
/st-louis-mo/st-louis-city/soulard/sewer-camera-inspection/
```

Audience + location:

```text
/st-louis-mo/st-louis-city/soulard/for/home-buyers/
```

Commercial + location:

```text
/st-louis-mo/st-louis-city/soulard/commercial/hydro-jetting/
```

This allows the routing system to support both shallow and nested geographic entities.

---

# 18. Canonical Service Hub

The canonical services hub is:

```text
/services/
```

It represents the company-wide service taxonomy.

---

# 19. Canonical Service Page Pattern

Company-wide service pages use:

```text
/services/{service}/
```

Examples:

```text
/services/sewer-camera-inspection/

/services/sewer-cleaning/

/services/hydro-jetting/

/services/sewer-cleaning-camera-inspection/

/services/sewer-line-locating/

/services/drain-cleaning/

/services/pre-purchase-sewer-inspection/
```

Canonical service slugs must come from:

`06-master-service-registry.md`

---

# 20. Service Alias Rule

Keyword aliases do not create alternate URLs.

Example:

```text
Sewer Scope
```

maps to:

```text
/services/sewer-camera-inspection/
```

Do not create:

```text
/services/sewer-scope/
```

unless an explicit future decision establishes it as a separate search intent.

---

# 21. Rooter Alias Rule

Terms such as:

```text
rooter service
sewer rooter
main line rooter
```

should generally map into the canonical sewer-cleaning entity.

Canonical page:

```text
/services/sewer-cleaning/
```

Do not create duplicate service URLs for vocabulary variants.

---

# 22. Service + Location Pattern

The canonical service + location pattern is:

```text
/{canonical-location-path}/{service}/
```

For standard one-segment locations:

```text
/{market}/{location}/{service}/
```

Example:

```text
/san-diego-ca/carlsbad/sewer-camera-inspection/
```

---

# 23. Correct Service + Location Examples

Approved structural examples:

```text
/st-louis-mo/chesterfield/sewer-camera-inspection/

/st-louis-mo/ballwin/pre-purchase-sewer-inspection/

/san-diego-ca/san-marcos/sewer-camera-inspection/

/san-diego-ca/escondido/sewer-cleaning/

/san-diego-ca/mission-valley/hydro-jetting/
```

---

# 24. Prohibited Flat Service + Location URLs

Do not use flattened keyword-concatenation patterns such as:

```text
/san-diego-ca/sewer-camera-inspection-carlsbad/

/st-louis-mo/hydro-jetting-chesterfield/

/las-vegas-nv/sewer-cleaning-henderson/
```

The canonical model is entity-hierarchical:

```text
Market
→
Location
→
Service
```

Preferred:

```text
/san-diego-ca/carlsbad/sewer-camera-inspection/
```

---

# 25. Why the Nested Model Is Preferred

The nested service + location model provides a clear relationship between:

* market
* local geography
* service

It also creates a predictable expansion system.

Conceptually:

```text
/san-diego-ca/
    /carlsbad/
        /sewer-camera-inspection/
        /sewer-cleaning/
        /hydro-jetting/
```

The routing hierarchy should reflect canonical entities rather than concatenated keyword strings.

---

# 26. Service + Location Publication Control

A URL being technically valid does not make it published or indexable.

For example:

```text
/san-diego-ca/carlsbad/hydro-jetting/
```

may be structurally valid.

It may exist as a registered candidate in local development or a protected preview. It must not enter the production route, canonical, sitemap, schema, navigation, or indexation systems unless `04-master-page-build-list.md` selects it for production.

This distinction must be enforced programmatically.

---

# 27. St. Louis Market-Specific Service Route

Market-specific services may live directly beneath the market hub when the intent genuinely belongs to that market rather than the global service taxonomy.

Approved example:

```text
/st-louis-mo/sewer-lateral-inspection-reporting/
```

This page is intentionally not:

```text
/services/sewer-lateral-inspection-reporting/
```

because the service is specifically tied to the St. Louis market.

---

# 28. Market-Specific Service Collision Control

A market-level child route can potentially represent either:

* a location
* a market-specific service

Example:

```text
/st-louis-mo/chesterfield/
```

is a location.

```text
/st-louis-mo/sewer-lateral-inspection-reporting/
```

is a market-specific service.

The route registry must determine entity type by the **complete pathname**, not by blindly assuming every second segment is a location.

---

# 29. Audience Hub

The audience parent route is:

```text
/for/
```

This should be used as the company-wide "Who We Serve" hub.

---

# 30. Audience Page Pattern

Canonical company-wide audience pages use:

```text
/for/{audience}/
```

Examples:

```text
/for/home-buyers/

/for/home-sellers/

/for/real-estate-agents/

/for/home-inspectors/

/for/property-managers/

/for/hoa-communities/
```

---

# 31. Why `/for/` Is Preferred

The `/for/` namespace is:

* concise
* flexible
* understandable
* scalable across residential, real estate, referral, and property audiences

It avoids unnecessarily long structures such as:

```text
/audiences/home-buyers/
```

or:

```text
/who-we-serve/home-buyers/
```

The visible navigation label may still be:

**Who We Serve**

while the route remains:

```text
/for/
```

---

# 32. Audience + Location Pattern

Approved future audience + location routes use:

```text
/{canonical-location-path}/for/{audience}/
```

Standard example:

```text
/san-diego-ca/carlsbad/for/home-buyers/
```

Nested geographic example:

```text
/st-louis-mo/st-louis-city/soulard/for/home-buyers/
```

These routes remain post-launch unless separately promoted in the Master Page Build List.

---

# 33. Do Not Reverse Audience + Location Order

Avoid:

```text
/for/home-buyers/carlsbad-ca/
```

The local architecture of the project treats geography as the primary parent for local audience variants.

Canonical model:

```text
Market
→
Location
→
Audience
```

---

# 34. Commercial Hub

The canonical commercial hub is:

```text
/commercial/
```

Commercial is treated as a first-class acquisition channel.

---

# 35. Commercial Service Pattern

Company-wide commercial services use:

```text
/commercial/{service}/
```

Approved examples:

```text
/commercial/sewer-camera-inspection/

/commercial/sewer-cleaning/

/commercial/hydro-jetting/

/commercial/drain-cleaning/

/commercial/preventative-maintenance/
```

---

# 36. Commercial Route Naming

Commercial service slugs should generally reuse the canonical service concept rather than unnecessarily repeating "commercial" inside the child slug.

Preferred:

```text
/commercial/hydro-jetting/
```

Avoid:

```text
/commercial/commercial-hydro-jetting/
```

The parent namespace already establishes commercial intent.

---

# 37. Commercial + Location Pattern

Local commercial pages use:

```text
/{canonical-location-path}/commercial/{service}/
```

Examples:

```text
/san-diego-ca/mission-valley/commercial/hydro-jetting/

/st-louis-mo/maryland-heights/commercial/sewer-cleaning/
```

when approved.

---

# 38. Do Not Flatten Commercial Local URLs

Avoid:

```text
/san-diego-ca/commercial-hydro-jetting-mission-valley/
```

or:

```text
/commercial/hydro-jetting/san-diego-ca/mission-valley/
```

Canonical model:

```text
Market
→
Location
→
Commercial
→
Service
```

---

# 39. Comparison Namespace

Comparison pages use:

```text
/compare/{comparison}/
```

Examples:

```text
/compare/independent-sewer-inspection-vs-repair-company/

/compare/hydro-jetting-vs-sewer-snaking/
```

---

# 40. Comparison Slug Rule

Comparison slugs should:

* clearly identify both concepts
* use `vs`
* remain concise
* avoid unnecessary words

Preferred:

```text
hydro-jetting-vs-sewer-snaking
```

Avoid:

```text
which-is-better-hydro-jetting-or-sewer-snaking-comparison
```

---

# 41. Comparison Pages Are Not Service Pages

Comparison pages must remain under:

```text
/compare/
```

Do not place them in:

```text
/services/
```

even when a comparison heavily discusses an offered service.

This preserves intent separation.

---

# 42. Alternative Namespace

Alternative pages use:

```text
/alternatives/{alternative}/
```

Examples:

```text
/alternatives/diy-sewer-camera-inspection/

/alternatives/renting-a-sewer-snake/

/alternatives/sewer-repair-company-inspection/
```

---

# 43. Resource Hub

The canonical resource hub is:

```text
/resources/
```

---

# 44. Launch Resource Pattern

Approved launch resources use:

```text
/resources/{resource}/
```

Examples:

```text
/resources/st-louis-sewer-lateral-report/

/resources/st-louis-city-sewer-lateral-program/

/resources/what-is-in-a-sewer-camera-inspection-report/

/resources/how-to-read-a-sewer-camera-inspection-video/
```

---

# 45. Future Resource Topic Hubs

As topical clusters expand, topic hubs may eventually be approved.

Potential structure:

```text
/resources/sewer-inspection/

/resources/hydro-jetting/

/resources/homebuyer-sewer-inspections/

/resources/commercial-sewer-maintenance/
```

These are structural possibilities, not current page approvals.

---

# 46. Future Nested Resource Articles

If content volume eventually justifies deeper resource organization, future articles may use:

```text
/resources/{topic}/{article}/
```

Example:

```text
/resources/sewer-inspection/common-sewer-camera-findings/
```

However, do not migrate existing resource URLs merely to make the architecture appear more uniform.

URL stability takes priority.

---

# 47. Resource URL Stability

Once an educational page is indexed at:

```text
/resources/what-is-in-a-sewer-camera-inspection-report/
```

it should remain there unless a substantial migration benefit justifies changing it.

Do not reorganize established URLs casually as resource clusters grow.

---

# 48. FAQ Route

The approved primary FAQ page is:

```text
/faq/
```

Individual FAQ questions should generally live:

* on relevant service pages
* on market pages
* on audience pages
* within resource content

Do not automatically create URLs such as:

```text
/faq/what-is-hydro-jetting/
```

for every question.

---

# 49. Legal and Utility Routes

When approved, standard utility pages should generally use simple root routes.

Potential examples:

```text
/privacy/
/terms/
/accessibility/
```

These should not be nested beneath:

```text
/resources/
```

or:

```text
/about/
```

unless an explicit architecture decision determines otherwise.

---

# 50. URL Parameter Rule

Indexable content should not rely on query parameters as its canonical identity.

Avoid canonical pages such as:

```text
/services/?service=hydro-jetting
```

or:

```text
/locations/?city=carlsbad
```

Indexable content receives a clean path.

---

# 51. Tracking Parameters

Marketing parameters such as:

```text
utm_source
utm_medium
utm_campaign
gclid
```

may appear during user sessions.

They should not create separate canonical URLs.

Canonical metadata should continue to point to the clean production pathname.

---

# 52. Slug Character Standard

Canonical slugs should use:

```text
a-z
0-9
hyphen
```

Avoid:

* spaces
* underscores
* ampersands
* commas
* apostrophes
* periods
* encoded punctuation
* unnecessary special characters

---

# 53. Lowercase Rule

All canonical URL path segments must be lowercase.

Preferred:

```text
/san-diego-ca/
```

Not:

```text
/San-Diego-CA/
```

Requests with incorrect capitalization should not become separately indexable URLs.

---

# 54. Hyphen Rule

Use hyphens to separate words.

Preferred:

```text
sewer-camera-inspection
```

Avoid:

```text
sewer_camera_inspection
sewercamerainspection
```

---

# 55. Unicode and Accent Normalization

Canonical slugs should use URL-safe ASCII where the approved registry has normalized accented characters.

Example:

```text
Rancho Peñasquitos
```

canonical slug:

```text
rancho-penasquitos
```

Do not create parallel accented and non-accented URLs.

---

# 56. Apostrophe Normalization

The canonical registry controls final apostrophe handling.

Examples may include:

```text
O'Fallon, MO
→
ofallon-mo
```

or an already approved location such as:

```text
Mountain's Edge
→
mountain-s-edge
```

Once a canonical slug is approved, **do not rerun it through a different generic slugification algorithm** and silently change it.

Registry values take precedence over generic normalization logic.

---

# 57. State Abbreviation Rule

Where state designation is part of a market slug, use the lowercase two-letter abbreviation.

Examples:

```text
mo
ca
nv
```

Do not alternate among:

```text
missouri
MO
mo
```

inside canonical market paths.

---

# 58. Ambiguous City Names

Where needed, the canonical registry may include a state indicator in a location slug to prevent ambiguity.

Example:

```text
/st-louis-mo/ofallon-mo/
```

The registry determines the canonical slug.

Do not simplify it in implementation because a shorter variation appears visually cleaner.

---

# 59. Route IDs vs Slugs

Internal entity IDs and public slugs serve different purposes.

Example:

```ts
serviceId: 'svc-sewer-camera-inspection'
slug: 'sewer-camera-inspection'
```

Never expose internal IDs as public routes.

Avoid:

```text
/services/svc-sewer-camera-inspection/
```

---

# 60. Stable Internal IDs

A slug may occasionally need to change.

The entity ID should usually remain stable.

Example:

```ts
id: 'loc-st-charles'
```

remains constant even if a future routing decision changes the display slug.

This makes migration and data relationships safer.

---

# 61. URL Length Principle

Keep URLs as short as the architecture permits without sacrificing clarity.

Preferred:

```text
/commercial/hydro-jetting/
```

Avoid:

```text
/commercial-services/commercial-sewer-and-drain-hydro-jetting-services/
```

---

# 62. Keyword Repetition Rule

Do not repeatedly insert the same keyword into the path.

Avoid:

```text
/sewer-services/sewer-cleaning/sewer-cleaning-services/
```

Use:

```text
/services/sewer-cleaning/
```

---

# 63. Geographic Repetition Rule

Avoid unnecessary geographic duplication.

Preferred:

```text
/san-diego-ca/carlsbad/
```

Avoid:

```text
/san-diego-ca/carlsbad-ca-san-diego-county/
```

The parent market already establishes geographic context.

---

# 64. Canonical Path Construction

Do not build URLs independently across multiple components.

Use centralized routing helpers.

Conceptually:

```ts
getServicePath(service)
getMarketPath(market)
getLocationPath(location)
getServiceLocationPath(page)
getAudiencePath(audience)
getAudienceLocationPath(page)
getCommercialPath(service)
getCommercialLocationPath(page)
getResourcePath(resource)
```

---

# 65. Prefer Stored Canonical Pathnames

Where practical, the route registry should store the stable pathname.

Example:

```ts
{
  id: 'sl-carlsbad-camera',
  pageType: 'service-location',
  pathname: '/san-diego-ca/carlsbad/sewer-camera-inspection/',
  serviceId: 'svc-sewer-camera-inspection',
  locationId: 'loc-carlsbad',
}
```

The application should not repeatedly reconstruct critical URLs from strings in page components.

---

# 66. Path Validation

Every registered pathname should pass validation.

Checks should include:

* starts with `/`
* ends with `/`
* lowercase only
* no spaces
* no underscores
* no duplicate slashes
* no query strings
* no fragments
* no duplicate pathname
* valid parent entity
* valid route record

---

# 67. Duplicate Route Detection

Route validation must fail if two registered page records resolve to the same pathname.

Example conflict:

```text
Page A:
/st-louis-mo/example/

Page B:
/st-louis-mo/example/
```

This should be treated as an architectural error rather than silently selecting one page.

---

# 68. Reserved Market-Child Collision Check

Within each market, validate collisions among:

* locations
* market-specific services
* future utility routes

Example:

```text
/st-louis-mo/sewer-lateral-inspection-reporting/
```

must not conflict with a location whose slug is:

```text
sewer-lateral-inspection-reporting
```

The route validator should detect this before build.

---

# 69. Nested Route Ambiguity

A three-segment market path may theoretically represent different page families.

Examples:

```text
/st-louis-mo/st-louis-city/soulard/
```

could represent a nested geographic page.

```text
/st-louis-mo/st-louis-city/sewer-camera-inspection/
```

represents a service + location page.

The system must resolve page identity using the validated route registry rather than trying to infer meaning from segment count alone.

---

# 70. Recommended App Router Strategy

Because market-local architecture includes variable geographic depth, a **registry-resolved catch-all market route** is recommended.

Conceptually:

```text
app/
├── [market]/
│   ├── page.tsx
│   └── [...segments]/
│       └── page.tsx
```

Next.js App Router supports catch-all dynamic segments using the `[...segment]` convention.

---

# 71. Why Catch-All Market Routing Fits This Project

A catch-all market route can support:

```text
/st-louis-mo/chesterfield/

/st-louis-mo/chesterfield/sewer-camera-inspection/

/st-louis-mo/st-louis-city/soulard/

/st-louis-mo/st-louis-city/soulard/sewer-camera-inspection/

/san-diego-ca/carlsbad/for/home-buyers/

/las-vegas-nv/las-vegas-strip/commercial/hydro-jetting/
```

without creating overlapping filesystem dynamic-route definitions.

---

# 72. Catch-All Routing Does Not Mean Automatic Publishing

This distinction is critical.

A catch-all filesystem route must **not** accept arbitrary runtime URL permutations.

The catch-all exists only to resolve registered paths from the environment-appropriate route collection.

Conceptual logic:

```ts
const page = getRouteRecordByPathname(pathname)

if (!page) {
  notFound()
}
```

The filesystem may technically recognize the pattern.

The route registry and current environment determine whether the path actually exists.

---

# 73. Static Parameter Generation

The market catch-all should receive only parameter sets allowed for the current environment.

Conceptually:

```ts
export function generateStaticParams() {
  return getRoutesForEnvironment().map((page) => ({
    market: page.marketSlug,
    segments: page.routeSegments,
  }))
}
```

`generateStaticParams()` is the App Router mechanism for pre-generating dynamic routes at build time.

Never populate it from:

```text
579 locations
×
18 services
```

---

# 74. Global Static Route Families

Global page families may use explicit directories.

Recommended conceptual structure:

```text
app/
├── page.tsx
├── about/
├── contact/
├── faq/
│
├── services/
│   ├── page.tsx
│   └── [service]/
│       └── page.tsx
│
├── locations/
│   └── page.tsx
│
├── for/
│   ├── page.tsx
│   └── [audience]/
│       └── page.tsx
│
├── commercial/
│   ├── page.tsx
│   └── [service]/
│       └── page.tsx
│
├── compare/
│   └── [comparison]/
│       └── page.tsx
│
├── alternatives/
│   └── [alternative]/
│       └── page.tsx
│
├── resources/
│   ├── page.tsx
│   └── [...]
│
└── [market]/
    ├── page.tsx
    └── [...segments]/
        └── page.tsx
```

Final implementation may vary, but route behavior must conform to this document.

---

# 75. Static Routes Take Priority Conceptually

Known global namespaces such as:

```text
/services/
/resources/
/commercial/
```

must remain dedicated global routes.

The market registry must never use these reserved terms as market IDs.

---

# 76. Page Registry Lookup

The routing layer should provide a deterministic lookup such as:

```ts
getPageByPathname(pathname)
```

or:

```ts
getPageByRoute({
  market,
  segments,
})
```

The lookup should return the registered page record for the current environment.

It should not invent a page object at request time when no registered record exists.

---

# 77. Unknown Route Behavior

Unknown paths must produce a legitimate 404.

Example:

```text
/san-diego-ca/fake-city/fake-service/
```

should not:

* dynamically construct a page
* fall back to San Diego
* redirect to the homepage
* return a thin generic template

It should return Not Found.

---

# 78. Static Export Requirement

Because the project uses static export, the dynamic routes for each environment need to be known during build generation.

Next.js static exports generate static files for the prebuilt route set.

This reinforces the project rule that route generation must consume a defined, validated collection. Candidate records may be generated for development; the production collection must remain deliberately filtered.

---

# 79. Canonical Metadata

Every indexable page should use its stable production pathname when generating canonical metadata. Draft and protected-preview routes must not emit themselves as production canonical URLs.

Conceptually:

```ts
alternates: {
  canonical: page.pathname,
}
```

or its fully resolved production URL.

Do not derive canonicals from:

* browser location
* preview deployment hostname
* query parameters
* referring page

---

# 80. Sitemap URL Consistency

Sitemap URLs must exactly match canonical URL style.

If canonical URLs use:

```text
/services/hydro-jetting/
```

the sitemap must not output:

```text
/services/hydro-jetting
```

Consistency should exist across:

* canonical metadata
* sitemap
* internal links
* breadcrumbs
* schema
* navigation

---

# 81. Internal-Link Consistency

Internal links should point directly to canonical URLs.

Avoid linking internally to a URL that immediately redirects.

Preferred:

```text
href="/services/hydro-jetting/"
```

Avoid intentionally linking to:

```text
href="/services/hydro-jetting"
```

when trailing slash is canonical.

---

# 82. Breadcrumb URL Consistency

Breadcrumb links should use the same approved canonical paths.

Example:

```text
Home
/
San Diego
/san-diego-ca/

Carlsbad
/san-diego-ca/carlsbad/

Sewer Camera Inspection
/san-diego-ca/carlsbad/sewer-camera-inspection/
```

---

# 83. Redirect Strategy

Redirects are migration infrastructure.

They should primarily address:

* legacy URLs
* changed slugs
* merged pages
* retired pages
* domain consolidation
* known aliases with existing traffic/backlinks

Redirect planning will be fully documented in:

`20-migration-redirect-plan.md`

---

# 84. Permanent Redirect Standard

When an established URL permanently moves to a replacement page, use a permanent redirect where appropriate.

The goal is to direct users and crawlers from the old URL to the new canonical destination.

---

# 85. Avoid Redirect Chains

Avoid:

```text
Old URL
→
Intermediate URL
→
New URL
```

Preferred:

```text
Old URL
→
Final Canonical URL
```

When routes change again in the future, existing redirect sources should be updated to point directly to the final destination where practical.

---

# 86. Avoid Redirect Loops

Validation must detect patterns such as:

```text
/a/
→
/b/

/b/
→
/a/
```

A redirect loop should fail QA.

---

# 87. Redirect Source Must Not Be Canonical Destination

No active canonical page should simultaneously exist as the source of a redirect.

Example invalid state:

```text
/services/hydro-jetting/
```

both:

* renders an indexable page
* redirects elsewhere

The route registry and redirect registry must be reconciled.

---

# 88. Cloudflare Pages Redirect Layer

For the static Cloudflare Pages deployment, redirects can be implemented through Cloudflare-supported redirect mechanisms rather than relying on a running Next.js server.

Cloudflare Pages supports `_redirects`, and currently documents limits of 2,000 static rules plus 100 dynamic rules per `_redirects` file; larger redirect sets can use Cloudflare Bulk Redirects.

This matters because migration from multiple legacy sites may eventually create a large redirect inventory.

---

# 89. Do Not Assume `next.config` Redirects Are the Deployment Layer

Next.js supports redirect definitions in `next.config`, but this project deploys as a static export.

For production migration behavior, the project should use the redirect mechanism verified to operate at the Cloudflare hosting layer.

The final implementation belongs in:

`20-migration-redirect-plan.md`

---

# 90. Redirect Registry

Redirects should be managed as structured data.

Conceptual example:

```ts
interface RedirectRecord {
  source: string
  destination: string
  permanent: boolean
  reason:
    | 'legacy-site'
    | 'slug-change'
    | 'page-merge'
    | 'domain-consolidation'
    | 'retired-page'
}
```

Potential location:

```text
data/redirects/redirects.ts
```

or an approved structured file.

---

# 91. Legacy Domain Consolidation

The project involves consolidating the existing web presence into the rebuilt multi-market architecture.

Domain-level and old-page redirects should preserve:

* relevant backlinks
* branded traffic
* existing bookmarks
* established indexed URLs
* high-value search landing pages

The complete mapping should not be created until the legacy URL inventory is completed.

---

# 92. Cloudflare Preview Domain

The Cloudflare `*.pages.dev` hostname must not become an alternate canonical version of the public site.

Cloudflare provides a mechanism for redirecting the Pages development hostname to the production custom domain when appropriate.

Production canonical metadata must use the approved production origin.

---

# 93. `www` vs Apex Governance

The project must eventually select one canonical host form:

```text
example.com
```

or:

```text
www.example.com
```

The noncanonical host should permanently redirect to the canonical host.

The exact production hostname will be documented in:

`20-migration-redirect-plan.md`

Do not allow both versions to operate independently.

---

# 94. HTTPS Requirement

Canonical URLs should use:

```text
https://
```

not:

```text
http://
```

Internal production configuration should consistently resolve to the secure origin.

---

# 95. Host Normalization

The final redirect system should normalize combinations such as:

```text
http + noncanonical host
http + canonical host
https + noncanonical host
```

into:

```text
https + canonical host
```

without unnecessary redirect chains where possible.

---

# 96. Indexation and Routing Are Separate

A page may technically have a route without being indexable.

Example:

```text
validation-pending
```

may be built for preview/QA.

Its presence in the build does not automatically authorize:

* sitemap inclusion
* public internal-link promotion
* search-engine submission

Indexation status belongs to the page record.

---

# 97. Noindex Is Not a Permanent Quality Substitute

Candidate and draft routes may be built locally or in protected previews. A deliberately published utility, campaign, or validation-pending page may also use `noindex` when the page registry requires it.

Do not publish thousands of speculative or low-value routes and treat `noindex` as a permanent substitute for prioritization, differentiation, or quality.

Preferred:

```text
Candidate or draft
→
Local / protected preview
→
Review and improve
→
Deliberate publication decision
→
Separate indexation decision
```

The production architecture should contain only intentionally published routes, whether `indexable` or deliberately `noindex`.

---

# 98. Matrix Routing Rule

The following is prohibited:

```ts
services.flatMap((service) =>
  locations.map((location) => ({
    pathname:
      `/${location.market}/${location.slug}/${service.slug}/`
  }))
)
```

The environment-filtered route registry must be the source. Raw matrix expansion must never feed the production route collection directly.

---

# 99. Correct Route Generation Model

```text
Service Registry
+
Location Registry
+
Opportunity Matrix
↓
Candidate Route Records
↓
Development / Protected Preview
↓
Master Page Build List
↓
Production Route Registry
↓
Canonical Pathname
↓
generateStaticParams()
↓
Static Production Route
```

---

# 100. No Search-Term Route Generation

Keyword research may discover phrases such as:

```text
sewer scope Carlsbad
sewer camera service Carlsbad
sewer video inspection Carlsbad
```

These should normally map to:

```text
/san-diego-ca/carlsbad/sewer-camera-inspection/
```

Do not create one route per query variation.

---

# 101. No Problem-Term Service Routes by Default

Problems such as:

```text
tree roots
sewer belly
offset pipe
cracked sewer pipe
slow sewer
```

do not automatically become service routes.

They should generally be handled through:

* resource pages
* FAQs
* service sections
* problem-topic clusters

unless they are later developed, differentiated, and deliberately selected as distinct production pages.

---

# 102. Route Family and Primary Intent

Each route family has a defined intent.

| Route Family                        | Primary Intent         |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `/services/{service}/`              | General service        |
| `/{market}/`                        | Market-wide local      |
| `/{market}/{location}/`             | Location-wide local    |
| `/{location}/{service}/`            | Local service          |
| `/for/{audience}/`                  | Audience               |
| `/{location}/for/{audience}/`       | Local audience         |
| `/commercial/{service}/`            | Commercial service     |
| `/{location}/commercial/{service}/` | Local commercial       |
| `/compare/{comparison}/`            | Decision/comparison    |
| `/alternatives/{alternative}/`      | Alternative evaluation |
| `/resources/{resource}/`            | Informational          |

This helps prevent search-intent overlap.

---

# 103. Canonical Consolidation Rule

If two proposed routes target essentially the same intent, they should be consolidated unless clear evidence supports separate pages.

Example:

```text
/services/sewer-camera-inspection/
```

and:

```text
/services/sewer-scope/
```

should not coexist merely because both terms receive searches.

---

# 104. Route Change Threshold

Published URLs should only change when there is a meaningful reason such as:

* incorrect geography
* severe architecture problem
* business consolidation
* duplicate-intent resolution
* legal/business-name change
* migration necessity

Do not change URLs because:

* a new keyword has slightly higher volume
* wording preferences change
* a new developer prefers another structure
* design navigation changes

---

# 105. URL Stability Principle

Once indexed, URLs become durable search and business infrastructure.

Treat them accordingly.

The cost of changing a route includes potential impacts on:

* backlinks
* bookmarks
* rankings
* analytics history
* citations
* internal links
* external references
* AI retrieval history

---

# 106. Route Change Workflow

Before changing an established route:

```text
Current URL
↓
Traffic / backlink / conversion review
↓
Determine replacement
↓
Document production URL decision
↓
Create permanent redirect
↓
Update internal links
↓
Update canonical
↓
Update sitemap
↓
Update schema
↓
Deploy
↓
Monitor
```

---

# 107. Slug Change Log

Material slug changes should be recorded in:

`22-decisions-change-log.md`

Include:

* old pathname
* new pathname
* reason
* date
* redirect requirement

---

# 108. Canonical Registry Validation

At build time, validate:

```text
services → unique canonical slug
markets → unique canonical slug
locations → unique canonical pathname
audiences → unique canonical slug
commercial services → unique canonical pathname
pages → unique canonical pathname
redirects → unique source
```

---

# 109. Case-Sensitive Data Governance

Canonical slugs in structured data must already be normalized.

Do not rely on runtime lowercasing to repair malformed registry entries.

Invalid data should fail validation.

---

# 110. Empty-Segment Validation

Route builders must reject malformed pathnames such as:

```text
/san-diego-ca//sewer-camera-inspection/
```

Every required route segment must resolve to an approved nonempty value.

The market hub is the exception because it intentionally contains no location segment.

---

# 111. Duplicate Slash Validation

Reject:

```text
//services//hydro-jetting//
```

Canonical form:

```text
/services/hydro-jetting/
```

---

# 112. Query and Fragment Exclusion

Stored canonical pathnames must never contain:

```text
?
#
```

These belong to request behavior or on-page navigation, not canonical route identity.

---

# 113. Navigation URLs

Navigation configuration should reference canonical page IDs or canonical pathnames.

Avoid manually recreating URLs inside header and footer components.

Preferred:

```ts
{
  label: 'Hydro Jetting',
  pageId: 'svc-hydro-jetting',
}
```

then resolve the canonical production pathname centrally.

---

# 114. CTA URLs

Service CTAs that lead to internal landing pages should also use canonical page records.

Form-anchor links may use fragments where appropriate:

```text
/services/sewer-camera-inspection/#request-service
```

but canonical metadata remains:

```text
/services/sewer-camera-inspection/
```

---

# 115. Location Card URLs

Location cards should use the canonical location pathname from the registry.

Do not recreate:

```ts
`/${market}/${slug}/`
```

inside every card component.

Central resolution prevents inconsistencies for nested geographic entities.

---

# 116. Related-Service URLs

Related-service modules should resolve service IDs to approved canonical pages.

Example:

```text
svc-hydro-jetting
→
/services/hydro-jetting/
```

Do not derive paths from visible display text.

---

# 117. Related Local Service URLs

When a local page links to a service + location page, verify that the destination exists in the Master Page Build List.

Do not create links to mathematically possible but unpublished matrix routes.

---

# 118. Breadcrumb Parent Resolution

Breadcrumb parentage should use page/entity relationships rather than parsing strings where possible.

For:

```text
/san-diego-ca/carlsbad/sewer-camera-inspection/
```

the logical hierarchy is:

```text
Home
→
San Diego Market
→
Carlsbad
→
Sewer Camera Inspection in Carlsbad
```

The breadcrumb system should know these entities from the page record.

---

# 119. Service Canonical vs Local Service Canonical

A local service page is a separate canonical page.

Example:

```text
/services/sewer-camera-inspection/
```

canonical:

```text
/services/sewer-camera-inspection/
```

while:

```text
/san-diego-ca/carlsbad/sewer-camera-inspection/
```

canonical:

```text
/san-diego-ca/carlsbad/sewer-camera-inspection/
```

Do not canonicalize every local page back to the global service page.

If a local page is not distinct enough to justify its own canonical, it should not be published.

---

# 120. Market Canonical vs City Canonical

Likewise:

```text
/san-diego-ca/
```

and:

```text
/san-diego-ca/san-diego/
```

should each self-canonicalize while both remain approved separate pages.

If future performance proves the intents are indistinguishable, consolidation should be handled through a deliberate migration decision.

---

# 121. Pagination

The current launch architecture does not require indexable pagination.

If resource archives eventually require pagination, define a dedicated strategy before implementation.

Do not improvise URLs such as:

```text
/resources/page/2/
```

without considering:

* canonical behavior
* indexation
* internal linking
* crawl value

---

# 122. Search Results Pages

If the site eventually includes internal search, search result pages should not become part of the indexable SEO architecture by default.

Avoid public indexation of query-driven routes such as:

```text
/search/?q=hydro+jetting
```

unless a future architecture specifically approves them.

---

# 123. Tag and Category Archives

Do not automatically create public indexable:

```text
/tags/
/categories/
```

archives simply because a content system supports them.

Topic hubs should be intentionally designed pages.

---

# 124. Future Market Expansion

A new market should follow:

```text
/{city-state}/
```

with approved locations beneath it.

Conceptually:

```text
/new-market-state/
    /location/
        /service/
        /for/audience/
        /commercial/service/
```

The exact future market slug must be entered into the market registry before route generation.

---

# 125. Future Service Expansion

A verified company-wide service selected for production receives:

```text
/services/{service}/
```

Local versions may subsequently receive:

```text
/{canonical-location-path}/{service}/
```

only where individually selected for production.

---

# 126. Future Audience Expansion

New company-wide audiences receive:

```text
/for/{audience}/
```

when deliberately selected for production. Candidate audience routes may be developed and reviewed earlier.

Local variants remain:

```text
/{canonical-location-path}/for/{audience}/
```

---

# 127. Future Commercial Expansion

New company-wide commercial services receive:

```text
/commercial/{service}/
```

Local commercial variants remain:

```text
/{canonical-location-path}/commercial/{service}/
```

---

# 128. Route Registry Example

A production registry may conceptually contain:

```ts
export const pages = [
  {
    id: 'svc-sewer-camera-inspection',
    pageType: 'service',
    pathname: '/services/sewer-camera-inspection/',
    buildStatus: 'build-ready',
    publicationStatus: 'published',
    indexationStatus: 'indexable',
  },

  {
    id: 'loc-sd-carlsbad',
    pageType: 'location',
    pathname: '/san-diego-ca/carlsbad/',
    marketId: 'san-diego-ca',
    buildStatus: 'build-ready',
    publicationStatus: 'published',
    indexationStatus: 'indexable',
  },

  {
    id: 'sl-carlsbad-camera',
    pageType: 'service-location',
    pathname:
      '/san-diego-ca/carlsbad/sewer-camera-inspection/',
    marketId: 'san-diego-ca',
    locationId: 'loc-sd-carlsbad',
    serviceId: 'svc-sewer-camera-inspection',
    buildStatus: 'build-ready',
    publicationStatus: 'published',
    indexationStatus: 'indexable',
  },
]
```

---

# 129. Route Segments Derived From Pathname

For static generation, the application may derive route segments from the registered stable pathname.

Example:

```ts
pathname:
  '/san-diego-ca/carlsbad/sewer-camera-inspection/'
```

becomes:

```ts
{
  market: 'san-diego-ca',
  segments: [
    'carlsbad',
    'sewer-camera-inspection',
  ],
}
```

The registered stable pathname remains the authority.

---

# 130. No Runtime Route Invention

The application should never receive:

```text
/san-diego-ca/random-place/random-service/
```

and then attempt to:

1. detect keywords,
2. find matching registry entities,
3. assemble generic content,
4. serve an indexable page.

Unknown combinations return 404.

---

# 131. Route Validation Script

A dedicated validation script is recommended.

Example:

```text
scripts/validate-routes.ts
```

It should verify:

* unique paths
* correct trailing slashes
* reserved-segment conflicts
* valid service references
* valid location references
* valid market references
* valid parent relationships
* correct page-family namespace
* recognized lifecycle, publication, and indexation status
* redirect conflicts

---

# 132. Production Route Validation

The build should fail if:

* two pages share a canonical pathname
* a page references an unknown service
* a local page references an unknown location
* an audience route uses an invalid audience
* a market-local route references the wrong market
* a draft, deferred, retired, or candidate page enters the production route collection unexpectedly
* a pathname violates canonical formatting
* a redirect conflicts with an active route

Failing the production build is preferable to silently publishing broken routing architecture. A draft or candidate route being incomplete should not block unrelated development when it remains outside the production collection.

---

# 133. Sitemap Generation Rule

Only pages satisfying both conditions should enter the production sitemap:

```text
publicationStatus = published
AND
indexationStatus = indexable
```

The exact field names must match `04-master-page-build-list.md`; the separation of publication from indexation is mandatory.

The sitemap should use the exact production canonical pathname.

Candidate, draft, build-ready, deferred, retired, preview-only, and deliberately `noindex` records must not enter the production sitemap unless their documented state changes.

---

# 134. Environment, Publication, and Indexation Rule

The route test is:

```text
Does a valid route record exist?
```

If no, the application must not invent one at runtime.

If yes, development and protected-preview environments may build the record according to their configured scope.

For production, ask:

```text
Does `04-master-page-build-list.md`
select this record for publication?
```

If no:

```text
Exclude it from the production route collection.
```

If yes:

```text
Use the stable pathname defined by
05-url-routing-strategy.md.
Then apply the separate indexation state
to canonicals, robots metadata, sitemap,
schema, navigation, and internal linking.
```

# 137. Prohibited Route Examples

Do not create:

```text
/sewer-camera-inspection-carlsbad-ca/
```

```text
/san-diego-ca/sewer-camera-inspection-carlsbad/
```

```text
/services/sewer-scope/
```

```text
/services/sewer-repair/
```

```text
/services/sewer-replacement/
```

```text
/las-vegas-nv/henderson/sewer-repair/
```

```text
/location?id=carlsbad
```

```text
/san-diego-ca/carlsbad-ca-san-diego-county/
```

```text
/commercial/commercial-hydro-jetting/
```

unless a future approved decision explicitly changes the architecture.

# 138. Critical Routing Rules

### Rule 1

Every page receives one canonical pathname.

### Rule 2

Canonical URLs use lowercase kebab-case.

### Rule 3

Canonical URLs use trailing slashes.

### Rule 4

Market hubs use `/{market}/`.

### Rule 5

Locations live beneath their parent market.

### Rule 6

Service + location pages append the service slug to the canonical pathname of the location.

### Rule 7

Do not use flat service-location keyword slugs.

### Rule 8

Company-wide services live under `/services/`.

### Rule 9

St. Louis-specific sewer lateral reporting remains under the St. Louis market.

### Rule 10

Company-wide audiences live under `/for/`.

### Rule 11

Local audiences use `{location}/for/{audience}/`.

### Rule 12

Commercial services live under `/commercial/`.

### Rule 13

Local commercial services use `{location}/commercial/{service}/`.

### Rule 14

Comparisons live under `/compare/`.

### Rule 15

Alternatives live under `/alternatives/`.

### Rule 16

Educational content lives under `/resources/`.

### Rule 17

Aliases and keyword variants do not automatically create routes.

### Rule 18

The canonical registry controls slugs; implementation must not silently re-slug canonical entities.

### Rule 19

Unknown permutations return 404.

### Rule 20

The full matrix must never power automatic route creation.

### Rule 21

Only the Master Page Build List selects routes for production publication and indexation.

### Rule 22

Published URLs should remain stable.

### Rule 23

URL changes require redirect evaluation.

### Rule 24

Internal links, canonicals, breadcrumbs, schema, and sitemaps must use the same canonical paths.

# 139. Project-Specific Technical Decision

The routing architecture should favor:

```text
Explicit global App Router namespaces
+
Registry-resolved market catch-all route
+
Environment-filtered static parameters
```

Conceptually:

```text
app/
├── services/
├── for/
├── commercial/
├── compare/
├── alternatives/
├── resources/
└── [market]/
    ├── page.tsx
    └── [...segments]/
        └── page.tsx
```

The catch-all mechanism provides routing flexibility.

The Master Page Build List provides publishing control.

Those two concepts must never be confused.

---

# 140. Final Routing Principle

The URL architecture should expose The Sewer Pros as a coherent entity system rather than a collection of keyword-generated landing pages.

The governing model is:

```text
Company
↓
Service

Company
↓
Market
↓
Location
↓
Service

Company
↓
Audience

Company
↓
Commercial Service

Company
↓
Resources / Comparisons / Alternatives
```

The implementation model is:

```text
Canonical Entity
+
Registered Page Record
+
Stable Pathname
+
Production Publication State
+
Static Generation
+
Route Validation
=
Production URL
```

The presence of:

* a keyword
* a location
* a service
* an audience
* a commercial segment
* a matrix relationship

never creates a URL by itself.

**The Master Page Build List controls production publication and indexation.
The URL Routing Strategy gives each registered page a stable address and each published page its permanent canonical URL.**
