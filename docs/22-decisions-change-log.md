# The Sewer Pros — Decisions & Change Log

**Document:** `22-decisions-change-log.md`
**Project:** The Sewer Pros Website Rebuild
**Repository:** `the-sewer-pros-site`
**Status:** Active Project Governance / Source of Truth
**Initial Baseline Date:** August 14, 2026

---

# 1. Purpose

This document records material project decisions, approved changes, architectural revisions, exceptions, overrides, and unresolved decisions for The Sewer Pros website rebuild.

It exists to prevent important project decisions from becoming scattered across:

* chat conversations
* Claude sessions
* GitHub commits
* VS Code notes
* research files
* implementation assumptions
* undocumented developer decisions

The purpose is to maintain a permanent project history answering:

> **What was decided, when was it decided, why was it decided, and which project documents or systems were affected?**

---

# 2. Governance Role

This document is the authoritative historical record of material project decisions.

It does **not** replace the subject-specific source-of-truth documents.

For example:

```text
Service taxonomy
→ 06-master-service-registry.md
```

```text
Approved routes
→ 04-master-page-build-list.md
```

```text
URL structure
→ 05-url-routing-strategy.md
```

```text
Technical architecture
→ 02-nextjs-technical-architecture.md
```

This log records **changes to those decisions and why they occurred**.

---

# 3. Site OS Relationship

Site OS Master remains the reusable operating system governing:

* workflows
* research procedures
* prompts
* QA
* gates
* implementation methodology
* validation
* efficiency

This project log should not duplicate generalized Site OS procedures.

Use this document when:

* The Sewer Pros needs a project-specific exception
* a project-specific architecture changes
* a business fact changes
* a service is added or removed
* a market changes
* a route strategy changes
* an approved page is added or retired
* a technical implementation decision materially changes
* a Site OS default requires a project-specific override

---

# 4. Decision Hierarchy

When conflicting project information exists, use the following priority:

```text
1. Most recent explicit approved project decision
2. Subject-specific source-of-truth document
3. This decisions/change log
4. Approved business/source data
5. Site OS Master
6. Validated research
7. Implementation convention
8. AI inference
```

This log should help identify the most recent approved decision.

---

## Business

* positioning
* service capabilities
* service exclusions
* markets
* audiences

# 6. What Does Not Need Logging

Do not record every minor implementation detail.

Examples that normally do not require entries:

* typo corrections
* minor spacing changes
* routine image replacement
* ordinary dependency patches
* non-material copy edits
* small refactors that do not change architecture
* routine QA fixes

Git history can capture normal implementation changes.

This log is for **decisions with future strategic relevance**.

* `03-information-architecture.md`
* `04-master-page-build-list.md`
* `05-url-routing-strategy.md`
* `07-master-location-registry.md`

### Decision

St. Louis, San Diego, and Las Vegas will operate within one primary website architecture.

Separate standalone websites will not be created for each market.

### Reason

A single-domain architecture allows:

* consolidated authority
* shared service entities
* scalable internal linking
* simpler brand management
* centralized content governance

---

# DEC-011 — Initial Primary Markets

**Date:** 2026-08-14
**Status:** APPROVED
**Impact:** Critical

# DEC-012 — Core Business Positioning

**Date:** 2026-08-14
**Status:** APPROVED
**Impact:** Critical
**Affected Documents:**

* `00-project-overview.md`
* `01-business-brand-foundation.md`
* `10-seo-strategy.md`
* `12-content-aeo-ai-strategy.md`
* `13-competitor-analysis.md`
* `14-content-specification.md`
* `17-conversion-architecture.md`
* `18-design-system.md`

### Decision

The Sewer Pros should be positioned primarily around:

```text
Sewer Inspection
+
Diagnostics
+
Cleaning
+
Hydro Jetting
+
Locating
+
Drain Cleaning
+
Pre-Purchase Inspection
+
Commercial Sewer/Drain Services
```

A central differentiator is:

> **Independent sewer inspection and cleaning without repair-driven upselling.**

---

# DEC-013 — Sewer Repair and Replacement Are Not Approved Services

**Date:** 2026-08-14
**Status:** APPROVED
**Impact:** Critical
**Affected Documents:** All service, content, schema, SEO, conversion, and design documents

### Decision

Do not position The Sewer Pros as a sewer repair or replacement contractor unless specifically approved later.

Unapproved service positioning includes:

* sewer line repair
* sewer replacement
* excavation
* trenchless replacement
* pipe bursting
* sewer lining
* major sewer construction

### Allowed Use

Repair and replacement topics may appear educationally in contexts such as:

* evaluating a repair recommendation
* determining whether repair may be necessary
* obtaining a second opinion
* comparing cleaning vs. structural repair

### Reason

The company's independent inspection model depends on maintaining a clear distinction between:

```text
Diagnosis
```

and:

```text
Selling the Repair
```

---

# DEC-014 — Scalable Multi-Market Page Architecture

**Date:** 2026-08-14
**Status:** APPROVED
**Impact:** Critical
**Affected Documents:** `03-information-architecture.md`, `04-master-page-build-list.md`

### Decision

* core service pages
* market hubs
* location pages
* service + location pages
* audience pages
* audience + location pages
* commercial pages
* commercial + location pages
* comparison pages
* alternative pages
* resource/topic clusters

### Rule

Architecture capability does not equal publishing approval.

---

# DEC-015 — Master Page Build List Is Publishing Authority

**Date:** 2026-08-14
**Status:** APPROVED
**Impact:** Critical
**Affected Documents:** Entire project

### Decision

`04-master-page-build-list.md`

is the authoritative registry controlling which public indexable routes may be created.

### Rule

A route must not be generated merely because it exists in:

* a keyword database
* a competitor analysis
* the location registry
* the service registry
* the service × location matrix
* AI output

### Governing Principle

```text
Opportunity
    ↓
Evaluation
    ↓
Master Page Build List Approval
    ↓
Build
    ↓
Index
```

---

# DEC-016 — Geographic Dataset Is Opportunity Intelligence

**Date:** 2026-08-14
**Status:** APPROVED
**Impact:** Critical
**Affected Documents:**

* `07-master-location-registry.md`
* `08-service-location-matrix.md`
* `21-post-launch-seo-roadmap.md`

### Decision

The project contains:

```text
579 normalized geographic records
```

These records are strategic research/data assets.

They do not automatically authorize:

```text
579 indexable location pages
```

---

# DEC-017 — Eighteen Canonical Service Records

**Date:** 2026-08-14
**Status:** APPROVED
**Impact:** Critical
**Affected Documents:** `06-master-service-registry.md`

### Decision

The project research contains:

```text
18 canonical service records
```

The Master Service Registry controls canonical naming, relationships, and service eligibility.

### Rule

AI, page copy, forms, schema, and code must not independently invent alternative canonical service taxonomies.

---

# DEC-018 — 10,422 Service × Location Relationships Are Not Automatic Pages

**Date:** 2026-08-14
**Status:** APPROVED
**Impact:** Critical
**Affected Documents:**

* `04-master-page-build-list.md`
* `08-service-location-matrix.md`
* `10-seo-strategy.md`
* `14-content-specification.md`
* `16-internal-linking-strategy.md`
* `21-post-launch-seo-roadmap.md`

### Decision

The project contains:

```text
10,422 service × location relationships
```

These represent potential SEO relationships.

### Explicit Rule

```text
relationship_exists
≠
publish_page
```

### Reason

This safeguard protects against:

* doorway-page creation
* thin content
* uncontrolled programmatic SEO
* index bloat
* duplicate content
* cannibalization

---

# DEC-019 — Controlled Geographic Expansion

**Date:** 2026-08-14
**Status:** APPROVED
**Impact:** High
**Affected Documents:** `21-post-launch-seo-roadmap.md`

```text
Approved Locations
        ↓
Publish Initial Cohort
        ↓
Measure
        ↓
Learn
        ↓
Approve Additional Cohort
```

Do not publish the entire geographic opportunity set simultaneously.

### Strategic Implication

St. Louis should support:

```text
Website
+
GBP
+
Local Search
```

as an integrated local ecosystem.

---

# DEC-021 — San Diego Has No Current Google Business Profile

**Date:** 2026-08-14
**Status:** APPROVED BASELINE FACT
**Impact:** High

Organic-First Local SEO
```

without pretending a physical branch exists.

---

# DEC-022 — Las Vegas Has No Current Google Business Profile

**Date:** 2026-08-14
**Status:** APPROVED BASELINE FACT
**Impact:** High

### Decision / Baseline

No current Las Vegas Google Business Profile has been identified.

```

with particular opportunity around commercial and property-management search.

---

# DEC-023 — No Fake Local Locations

**Date:** 2026-08-14
**Status:** APPROVED
**Impact:** Critical
**Affected Documents:**

* `07-master-location-registry.md`
* `11-local-seo-gbp-strategy.md`
* `14-content-specification.md`

for SEO purposes.

### Reason

Market coverage and physical business presence are separate concepts.

---

**Status:** APPROVED
**Impact:** High
**Affected Documents:** `15-schema-entity-strategy.md`

---

# DEC-025 — LocalBusiness Requires Verified Real Location

**Date:** 2026-08-14
**Status:** APPROVED
**Impact:** High
**Affected Documents:** `15-schema-entity-strategy.md`

### Decision

`LocalBusiness` schema should only be used where a legitimate physical operating location/branch has been verified and approved.

### Implication

San Diego and Las Vegas should not automatically receive LocalBusiness entities because market pages exist.

Use appropriate relationships such as:

```text
Service
+
areaServed
+
Place
```

instead.

---

# DEC-026 — Service Schema Represents Approved Services

**Date:** 2026-08-14
**Status:** APPROVED
**Impact:** Medium
**Affected Documents:** `15-schema-entity-strategy.md`

**Date:** 2026-08-14
**Status:** APPROVED
**Impact:** Medium
**Affected Documents:**

**Date:** 2026-08-14
**Status:** APPROVED
**Impact:** Medium
**Affected Documents:** `15-schema-entity-strategy.md`

* `14-content-specification.md`
* `16-internal-linking-strategy.md`
* `17-conversion-architecture.md`

### Decision

Commercial sewer/drain services should not be buried as a small subsection of residential content.

Commercial should support:

```text
Commercial Hub
        ↓
Commercial Services
        ↓
Commercial Markets
        ↓
Commercial Audiences
        ↓
Commercial Resources

Resources
```

Avoid uncontrolled many-to-many link grids.

---

# DEC-039 — Canonical Service Pages Remain Primary Service Authority

**Date:** 2026-08-14
**Status:** APPROVED
**Impact:** High

### Decision

Localized service pages should reinforce rather than replace the canonical general service page.

**Date:** 2026-08-14
**Status:** APPROVED
**Impact:** Medium
**Affected Documents:** `21-post-launch-seo-roadmap.md`

X posts per week
```

publishing quota.

Content velocity should follow:

* opportunity
* research quality
* workflow capacity
* business relevance

---

# DEC-044 — Design Should Emphasize Technical Precision

**Date:** 2026-08-14
**Status:** APPROVED DESIGN DIRECTION
**Impact:** High
**Affected Documents:** `18-design-system.md`

The design direction should communicate:

```text
Industrial Precision
+
Modern Editorial Design

**Date:** 2026-08-14
**Status:** APPROVED
**Impact:** High
**Affected Documents:** `19-analytics-measurement.md`

```text
Qualified Leads
+
Search Visibility

Conversion Performance
```

rather than:

* raw pageviews

---

# DEC-048 — Core Analytics Stack

**Date:** 2026-08-14
**Status:** APPROVED
**Impact:** High
**Affected Documents:** `19-analytics-measurement.md`

---

# DEC-051 — Migration Must Preserve Existing Search Equity

**Date:** 2026-08-14
**Status:** APPROVED
**Impact:** Critical
**Affected Documents:** `20-migration-redirect-plan.md`

### Decision

Before launch, inventory legacy URLs and map valuable URLs to approved new destinations.

### Rule

Do not treat the redesign as a reason to discard existing URL equity.

---

# DEC-052 — No Mass Redirect to Homepage

**Date:** 2026-08-14
**Status:** APPROVED
**Impact:** Critical
**Affected Documents:** `20-migration-redirect-plan.md`

### Decision

Removed legacy URLs should not automatically redirect to the homepage.

Preferred redirect hierarchy:

```text
Exact Equivalent
        ↓
Closest Relevant Approved Page
        ↓
Relevant Hub
        ↓
404 / 410
```

---

# DEC-053 — Permanent Redirects Should Be Direct

**Date:** 2026-08-14
**Status:** APPROVED
**Impact:** High

### Decision

Permanent migrations should normally use a direct permanent redirect.

Avoid redirect chains and loops.

---

# DEC-054 — New Internal Links Must Use Final Canonical URLs

**Date:** 2026-08-14
**Status:** APPROVED
**Impact:** High

### Decision

Internal links should not rely on migration redirects.

External legacy URLs may redirect.

Internal navigation should point directly to the canonical destination.

---

# DEC-055 — Post-Launch SEO Uses Controlled Expansion

**Date:** 2026-08-14
**Status:** APPROVED
**Impact:** Critical
**Affected Documents:** `21-post-launch-seo-roadmap.md`

### Decision

Post-launch growth should follow:

```text
Stabilize
→ Measure
→ Improve
→ Expand
→ Measure Again
```

Do not immediately publish every theoretical route after launch.

---

# DEC-056 — Improve Existing Opportunities Before Unlimited Expansion

**Date:** 2026-08-14
**Status:** APPROVED
**Impact:** High

### Decision

Pages already receiving:

* impressions
* clicks
* conversions

should often be optimized before creating large quantities of new pages.

---

# DEC-057 — Geographic Expansion Uses Cohorts

**Date:** 2026-08-14
**Status:** APPROVED
**Impact:** High

### Decision

New location and service + location pages should preferably launch in measurable cohorts.

This allows performance feedback before additional expansion.

---

# DEC-058 — St. Louis Is the Strongest Existing Local Entity Market

**Date:** 2026-08-14
**Status:** APPROVED STRATEGIC BASELINE
**Impact:** High

### Decision

St. Louis should initially receive particular emphasis around:

* GBP integration
* sewer laterals
* pre-purchase inspection
* real estate
* local authority

because it has the strongest existing established local presence.

---

# DEC-059 — San Diego Initially Uses Organic-First Market Growth

**Date:** 2026-08-14
**Status:** APPROVED
**Impact:** High

### Decision

Until an eligible real San Diego GBP exists, San Diego growth should focus on:

* market authority
* service authority
* real-estate intent
* selected local pages
* independent inspection positioning
* local references

---

# DEC-060 — Las Vegas Initially Uses Organic-First Market Growth

**Date:** 2026-08-14
**Status:** APPROVED
**Impact:** High

### Decision

Until an eligible real Las Vegas GBP exists, Las Vegas growth should emphasize:

* sewer diagnostics
* hydro jetting
* drain cleaning
* line locating
* property management
* commercial SEO
* selected local pages

---

# 13. Current Unresolved / Implementation-Dependent Decisions

The following items may require future decisions or verification.

They are not approved merely because they are listed here.

---

## PENDING-001 — Production Canonical Domain

**Status:** OPEN

Confirm the exact production canonical domain and preferred host format:

```text
apex
vs.
www
```

Once approved, update:

* URL strategy
* schema IDs
* sitemap
* canonical metadata
* analytics
* Search Console
* migration plan

---

## PENDING-002 — St. Louis Physical Entity Details

**Status:** OPEN

Verify the exact public business information associated with the existing St. Louis GBP, including as applicable:

* address/publication status
* phone
* hours
* categories
* service areas
* website destination

This determines the final LocalBusiness schema treatment.

---

## PENDING-003 — San Diego GBP Eligibility

**Status:** DEFERRED

Determine later whether The Sewer Pros qualifies for a legitimate San Diego Google Business Profile.

No GBP or LocalBusiness entity should be fabricated while this remains unresolved.

---

## PENDING-004 — Las Vegas GBP Eligibility

**Status:** DEFERRED

Determine later whether The Sewer Pros qualifies for a legitimate Las Vegas Google Business Profile.

---

## PENDING-005 — Final Brand Color Palette

**Status:** OPEN

Confirm official approved brand colors from final source assets.

Until then, `18-design-system.md` defines semantic visual direction rather than permanent HEX values.

---

## PENDING-006 — Final Typography

**Status:** OPEN

Select production font family/families during design implementation.

---

## PENDING-007 — Primary Conversion Label

**Status:** OPEN

Finalize global primary CTA language.

Candidates may include:

```text
Request Service
Schedule an Inspection
Request an Inspection
```

Page-specific CTAs should remain intent-aware.

---

## PENDING-008 — Final Form Fields

**Status:** OPEN — reviewed 2026-08-17 under DEC-080, NOT resolved

⚠ This was proposed for closure alongside DEC-080 and is deliberately left open. No form exists on any page in any market: there is no `components/forms/`, no `<form>` element in any source file, and zero `<form>` tags across all 73 built pages. Nothing has been decided or built, so there is nothing to mark resolved.

DEC-080 does not depend on it. Criterion 4 (service-request handling) is satisfied by the published phone and email (DEC-073), which is a real mechanism that exists today. A form was never what that criterion relied on, so leaving this open does not reopen the Las Vegas gate.

Confirm operational requirements for:

* general service form
* pre-purchase inspection form
* commercial form

Keep forms as short as operationally practical.

---

## PENDING-009 — Call Tracking

**Status:** DEFERRED / OPTIONAL

Determine whether dynamic call tracking will be implemented.

Any implementation must preserve NAP/entity consistency.

---

## PENDING-010 — Final Redirect Inventory

**Status:** OPEN UNTIL MIGRATION RESEARCH

Legacy URLs must be fully inventoried before launch.

---

## PENDING-011 — GPTBot Training-Access Policy

**Status:** OPEN

Determine whether `GPTBot` should be allowed or disallowed in production `robots.txt`.

This is a business preference regarding AI model-training use of site content.

It is **independent of** search visibility:

```text
OAI-SearchBot → allowed (DEC-062)
GPTBot        → undecided
```

Allowing or blocking `GPTBot` has no effect on ChatGPT search visibility.

Considerations:

* whether the business wants its content used for model training
* whether original inspection imagery, reports, or case studies change that calculus
* whether competitors' choices are relevant (they are not binding)

**Trigger:** before production `robots.txt` is finalized.

Do not write the `GPTBot` directive until this is resolved. Do not resolve it by inheriting a template default.

---

## PENDING-012 — Las Vegas Service Availability Validation

**Status:** RESOLVED 2026-08-17 by DEC-080 — all eight DEC-063 criteria satisfied; the five Las Vegas pages are `launch` and indexable

Confirmed the eight release criteria in DEC-063 before promoting any Las Vegas page from `launch_pending_validation` to `launch`. **All eight are now satisfied and the promotion has been made under DEC-080.**

| # | Criterion | Status |
| - | --------- | ------ |
| 1 | Active operational coverage | ✅ DEC-074 — owner reports operational |
| 2 | Services actually offered | ✅ DEC-076 — 17/18; the 18th is St. Louis-specific, not a gap |
| 3 | Contact routing functional | ✅ DEC-080 — owner confirmation (private) |
| 4 | Service-request handling | ✅ DEC-080 — published phone and email (DEC-073); a form was never the mechanism this relied on |
| 5 | Geographic coverage confirmed | ✅ The four approved Las Vegas locations define it (DEC-077) |
| 6 | Market business facts verified | ✅ DEC-073 — phone, email, hours |
| 7 | Licensing satisfied | ✅ DEC-080 — owner confirmation (private), not published, per DEC-072 |
| 8 | Public messaging accurate | ✅ DEC-074 |

⚠ Criteria 3, 4, and 7 closed on **owner confirmation, not repository-verifiable evidence**. Earlier reviews recorded 3 and 7 as blocking precisely because nothing in the repo demonstrated them, and nothing in the repo demonstrates them now either. What changed is that the owner supplied the confirmation, which is the only place it could come from. That distinction is preserved here rather than smoothed over.

⚠ Criterion 2 was also once recorded as closed at 13 of 18 under DEC-075. DEC-076 superseded that with 17 of 18, which is what the live registry supports. See DEC-080 for the full reconciliation.

**Nothing is gated:**

```text
0 market hubs
0 location pages
0 service + location pages (none authorized for generation)
```

Promotion required a doc 04 change plus a decision entry, per DEC-063. Both were made. Nothing in the implementation promoted a page on its own — and note that two code changes beyond the status flip were needed for the release to actually take effect; DEC-080 records them.

This is separate from PENDING-004. Service availability is a prerequisite for a GBP, not a consequence of one.

---

# 14. Superseding a Decision

When a decision changes:

1. Do not delete the original entry.
2. Change its status to `SUPERSEDED`.
3. Add the ID of the new decision.
4. Create a new decision entry.
5. Update affected source-of-truth documents.
6. Update implementation if necessary.

Example:

```markdown
**Status:** SUPERSEDED  
**Superseded By:** DEC-0xx
```

This preserves project history.

---

# 15. Reversing a Decision

If the project intentionally returns to a previous strategy:

* mark the current decision `REVERSED`
* create a new decision explaining the reversal
* do not simply delete both entries

The history of why the project changed remains valuable.

---

# 16. Deferred Decisions

A deferred decision should record:

* what was considered
* why it was postponed
* what would trigger reconsideration

Example:

```text
San Diego GBP
Deferred until operational eligibility is confirmed.
```

This prevents the same unresolved question from being repeatedly re-decided.

---

# 17. Rejected Proposals

Important rejected proposals may also be logged.

Example:

```text
Proposal:
Automatically generate all 10,422 service × location pages.

Status:
REJECTED

Reason:
Matrix represents opportunity intelligence, not publishing approval.
```

Logging major rejected ideas prevents future regression.

---

# 18. AI Decision Rule

Claude, Claude Code, or another AI system must not silently convert an inference into a project decision.

If a task encounters an unresolved architectural issue:

```text
Existing Approved Rule
→ Follow It
```

If no approved rule exists:

```text
Implementation-Safe Default
+
Document Decision Need
```

For material changes, update this log once the decision is approved.

---

# 19. Claude Code Rule

`CLAUDE.md` should instruct Claude Code to:

* consult source-of-truth documentation
* respect approved decisions
* avoid inventing business facts
* avoid changing architecture silently
* update project documentation when material approved changes occur

A code implementation should not supersede repository governance merely because it exists in production.

---

# 20. Git History Relationship

Git provides:

```text
What changed in files?
```

This document provides:

```text
Why did the project decide to change it?
```

Both are required for long-term project maintainability.

---

# 21. Decision Entry Naming

Use sequential IDs:

```text
DEC-EXAMPLE-1
DEC-EXAMPLE-2
DEC-EXAMPLE-3
...
```

Real IDs are `DEC-` plus a zero-padded three-digit number. The
placeholders above are deliberately not in that form so a search for
real entries never matches this illustration.

Do not reuse deleted or superseded numbers.

Pending questions may temporarily use:

```text
PENDING-###
```

until formally resolved.

When approved, create a new permanent `DEC-###` entry.

---

# 22. Recommended Commit Practice

When a material decision is implemented, the related Git commit or pull request should ideally reference the decision ID.

Example:

```text
feat: add verified Las Vegas market entity [DEC-0xx]
```

or:

```text
docs: update service taxonomy [DEC-0xx]
```

This is recommended for significant changes, not required for every commit.

---

# 23. Decision Review Triggers

Review this document when:

* a new service is proposed
* repair/replacement capabilities change
* a new market is added
* a GBP is created
* a location becomes a verified branch
* the canonical domain changes
* page architecture changes
* route conventions change
* large page cohorts are approved
* a major SEO strategy changes
* analytics architecture changes
* conversion strategy materially changes

---

# 24. Service Change Procedure

If a new service is added:

```text
Business Approval
        ↓
New DEC Entry
        ↓
06-master-service-registry.md
        ↓
04-master-page-build-list.md
        ↓
Matrices
        ↓
Content
        ↓
Schema
        ↓
Internal Linking
        ↓
Analytics
```

Do not add the page first and update governance later.

---

# 25. New Market Procedure

If a new market is approved:

```text
Business Approval
        ↓
New DEC Entry
        ↓
07-master-location-registry.md
        ↓
04-master-page-build-list.md
        ↓
URL Strategy
        ↓
SEO / Local SEO
        ↓
Schema
        ↓
Internal Linking
        ↓
Analytics
```

---

# 26. GBP Change Procedure

If San Diego or Las Vegas receives a legitimate GBP:

```text
Verify Eligibility
        ↓
Verify Business Data
        ↓
New DEC Entry
        ↓
11-local-seo-gbp-strategy.md
        ↓
15-schema-entity-strategy.md
        ↓
Analytics
        ↓
Market Pages
```

Do not automatically create a LocalBusiness entity merely because a profile request was submitted.

---

# 27. Repair Capability Change Procedure

If the company begins providing sewer repair or replacement:

This is a **Critical** decision.

Required review includes:

* positioning
* brand
* service registry
* page build list
* competitor strategy
* content specification
* schema
* internal linking
* conversion
* design
* analytics

A repair capability change affects the site's fundamental competitive positioning.

---

# 28. Route Change Procedure

Before changing an established production URL:

1. identify why the URL must change
2. review organic performance
3. review backlinks
4. review internal links
5. approve the architectural decision
6. create/update decision log if material
7. implement permanent redirect
8. update canonical references
9. update sitemap
10. monitor migration

Do not change URLs solely for minor keyword preference.

---

# 29. Large Page Cohort Approval

When a significant location or service + location cohort is approved, record a decision if it materially expands the indexed architecture.

Example:

```text
DEC-0xx
Approve first 25 San Diego service + location pages
```

The entry should record:

* page family
* market
* number of routes
* strategic rationale
* expected measurement period

This creates accountability for scaled publishing.

---

# 30. Post-Launch Decision Feedback

Performance data may change project priorities.

Example:

```text
Initial assumption:
Homebuyer content is highest-value in San Diego.

Observed data:
Commercial hydro jetting substantially outperforms real-estate intent.

Decision:
Increase Las Vegas commercial priority.
```

A material strategic reprioritization should be logged.

---

# 31. Avoid Rewriting History

Do not edit old decision entries so they appear to support newer thinking.

Instead:

```text
Old Decision
        ↓
Superseded
        ↓
New Decision
```

The change history is part of the value of this document.

---

# 32. Document Update Requirement

When a decision affects another source-of-truth file, both must be updated.

Example:

If a service is retired:

```text
22-decisions-change-log.md
+
06-master-service-registry.md
+
04-master-page-build-list.md
+
Relevant matrices
```

The change log alone does not update operational truth.

---

# 33. Source-of-Truth Conflict Example

Suppose:

`06-master-service-registry.md`

lists:

```text
Sewer Repair — Not Offered
```

but a new page is accidentally built at:

```text
/services/sewer-repair/
```

The code does not override the registry.

The correct response is:

```text
Fix the implementation
```

unless an approved decision explicitly changed the service capability.

---

# 34. Content Conflict Example

Suppose an AI-generated draft claims:

> The Sewer Pros provides trenchless sewer replacement.

But no approved decision changed DEC-013.

The content is incorrect and must be revised.

AI output does not create project truth.

---

# 35. Local Entity Conflict Example

Suppose a Las Vegas page includes:

```text
Our Las Vegas Office
```

but DEC-022 and DEC-023 remain active.

The page is incorrect.

A market page does not create a physical branch.

---

# 36. Matrix Conflict Example

Suppose:

`08-service-location-matrix.md`

contains:

```text
Hydro Jetting × Location X
```

but the route is absent from:

`04-master-page-build-list.md`

The page is not approved.

DEC-015 and DEC-018 control.

---

# 37. Current Non-Negotiable Decisions

Unless explicitly superseded, the following are foundational:

```text
DEC-003
Site OS Master governs reusable methodology.
```

```text
DEC-012
Independent inspection/diagnostics/cleaning positioning.
```

```text
DEC-013
No repair/replacement contractor positioning.
```

```text
DEC-015
Master Page Build List controls publishing.
```

```text
DEC-018
10,422 matrix relationships are not automatic pages.
```

```text
DEC-023
No fake local locations.
```

These should be treated as major guardrails by Claude, developers, content creators, and future project contributors.

---

# 38. Active Decision Log Template

Add future entries below this point in chronological order.

## DEC-061 — Trailing-Slash Canonical Convention

**Date:** 2026-08-14
**Status:** APPROVED
**Impact:** High
**Decision Owner:** Project
**Affected Documents:**

* `02-nextjs-technical-architecture.md` §7
* `05-url-routing-strategy.md` §5, §6, §46, §138 Rule 3
* `15-schema-entity-strategy.md` §114
* `20-migration-redirect-plan.md` §46

### Decision

The project uses:

```ts
trailingSlash: true
```

All canonical URLs end with `/`.

### Reason

`05-url-routing-strategy.md` §5 established the routing convention as the subject-specific authority for URL structure and explicitly finalized the trailing-slash decision for this project.

Consistency is required because the value propagates into canonical tags, sitemap entries, schema `@id` values, breadcrumb items, internal links, and redirect normalization. A mismatch between any two of those layers produces duplicate-URL signals.

### Previous State

`02-nextjs-technical-architecture.md` §7 contained an illustrative configuration example showing:

```ts
trailingSlash: false
```

That value was an early placeholder written before the routing strategy existed. It was never an approved project decision.

### New State

```text
trailingSlash: true
```

is the authoritative production setting.

`02-nextjs-technical-architecture.md` §7 has been corrected and now carries an explicit note identifying the superseded value and pointing to this decision.

### Implementation Impact

* `next.config.ts` must set `trailingSlash: true`
* canonical metadata must emit trailing slashes
* sitemap URLs must emit trailing slashes
* schema `@id` / `url` / `mainEntityOfPage` / breadcrumb items must emit trailing slashes
* internal `Link` hrefs must include trailing slashes
* non-slash variants must normalize via redirect rather than serving independent `200` responses
* route validation should reject stored pathnames lacking a trailing slash

### Follow-Up

Route-validation tooling (`05-url-routing-strategy.md` §66, §131) should enforce this as a build-time check rather than relying on developer discipline.

---

## DEC-062 — AI Crawler Access Policy (Search vs. Training)

**Date:** 2026-08-14
**Status:** APPROVED (search access) / see PENDING-011 (training access)
**Impact:** Medium
**Decision Owner:** Project
**Affected Documents:**

* `12-content-aeo-ai-strategy.md` §120, §121, §122
* `02-nextjs-technical-architecture.md` §42

### Decision

The project treats AI search-discovery access and AI model-training access as **two separate decisions**.

**Approved now:**

```text
OAI-SearchBot → Allow
```

Production `robots.txt` must not block `OAI-SearchBot`, because doing so removes the site from ChatGPT search answers.

**Not decided:**

```text
GPTBot → Undecided
```

See PENDING-011.

### Reason

`12-content-aeo-ai-strategy.md` §121 establishes that search-visibility permission does not imply training permission. OpenAI documents the two crawlers separately, so the project can pursue AI-search visibility while treating training access as an independent business decision.

Blocking the search crawler would forfeit a discovery channel the AEO strategy actively targets. Blocking or allowing the training crawler carries no search-visibility consequence and is therefore a business preference rather than an SEO decision.

### Previous State

No documented crawler policy. Risk of silently inheriting a generic `robots.txt` that resolved both questions by accident.

### New State

```text
OAI-SearchBot: allowed (approved)
GPTBot: unresolved, must be decided before launch
```

### Implementation Impact

* `app/robots.ts` must explicitly allow `OAI-SearchBot`
* `app/robots.ts` must not include a blanket AI-crawler disallow that catches `OAI-SearchBot` as a side effect
* the GPTBot directive must not be written until PENDING-011 is resolved
* do not add `llms.txt` as a substitute for either decision (`12-content-aeo-ai-strategy.md` §123)

### Follow-Up

Resolve PENDING-011 before production launch. Once decided, supersede this entry or append a new decision recording the GPTBot directive.

---

## DEC-063 — Las Vegas Operational Validation Gate

**Date:** 2026-08-14
**Status:** APPROVED
**Impact:** High
**Decision Owner:** Project
**Affected Documents:**

* `04-master-page-build-list.md` §10.3, §14, §19, §43, §51
* `06-master-service-registry.md` §7, §42
* `08-service-location-matrix.md` §26, §27
* `11-local-seo-gbp-strategy.md` §67, §68, §69
* `21-post-launch-seo-roadmap.md` §38

### Decision

Las Vegas pages may be **built and QA'd** but must not be **indexed** until operational service availability is confirmed.

Five pages carry status `launch_pending_validation`:

```text
/las-vegas-nv/
/las-vegas-nv/las-vegas/
/las-vegas-nv/henderson/
/las-vegas-nv/north-las-vegas/
/las-vegas-nv/summerlin/
```

Zero Las Vegas service + location pages are authorized for generation at this stage.

### Reason

The Las Vegas geographic and service opportunity model is established, but the service registry does not mark the market's individual service menu as operationally confirmed. Publishing indexable service claims for a market whose delivery capability is unverified would create inaccurate customer-facing commitments.

This is a business-accuracy gate, not an SEO-performance gate.

### Previous State

DEC-022 recorded the absence of a Las Vegas GBP as a baseline fact. It did not record the separate service-availability gate governing website indexation.

### New State

The gate is explicit and its release criteria are defined.

**Release criteria** (from `04-master-page-build-list.md` §43) — confirm all before promoting any Las Vegas page to `launch`:

1. active operational coverage
2. services actually offered
3. contact routing functional
4. service-request handling functional
5. geographic coverage confirmed
6. market-specific business facts verified
7. applicable licensing/business requirements satisfied
8. public messaging accurate

### Implementation Impact

* Las Vegas routes generate but must emit `noindex`
* Las Vegas routes must be excluded from the XML sitemap
* Las Vegas routes must not appear in indexable internal-link modules
* Las Vegas pages must not be submitted to Search Console or Bing
* promotion to `launch` requires updating `04-master-page-build-list.md` and a new DEC entry

### Follow-Up

Tracked as PENDING-012. Note this gate is **independent of** PENDING-004 (GBP eligibility) — service availability could be confirmed without a GBP, and a GBP could not be created without service availability.

## DEC-064 — Interim Ownership of Visual Identity Values

**Date:** 2026-08-14
**Status:** PROPOSED
**Impact:** Medium
**Decision Owner:** *Awaiting project approval*
**Affected Documents:**

* `01-business-brand-foundation.md`
* `18-design-system.md` §6, §7, §8, §9, §14

### Decision (proposed)

Until final brand assets are supplied, `18-design-system.md` holds **interim authority** for visual-identity values: color roles, typography selection, iconography style, and photography direction.

When verified brand assets arrive, those values move to `01-business-brand-foundation.md` as approved brand facts, and `18-design-system.md` reverts to deferring to it.

### Reason

`18-design-system.md` §6 currently states that approved values in `01-business-brand-foundation.md` supersede the design system's provisional recommendations. However, `01-business-brand-foundation.md` contains no visual-identity section — it covers positioning, voice, messaging boundaries, and trust architecture, but not colors, type, or imagery.

The deferral therefore points at content that does not exist, leaving no document with authority over these values. Implementation would have to either invent them or stall.

This proposal resolves the gap without inventing brand facts: the design system already defines *semantic roles* (`Brand Primary`, `Accent`, `Surface`) rather than specific values, which is a safe interim position. It names an owner for the role definitions while leaving the concrete values open.

### Previous State

```text
18-design-system.md §6 → defers to 01-business-brand-foundation.md
01-business-brand-foundation.md → contains no visual-identity section
Result: no owner
```

### New State (if approved)

```text
Interim:  18-design-system.md owns semantic visual roles
Final:    01-business-brand-foundation.md owns verified brand values
Trigger:  delivery of approved brand assets
```

### Implementation Impact

* implementation may proceed against semantic tokens (`--brand`, `--accent`, `--surface`) without final values
* CSS variables and Tailwind theme tokens must be centralized so values can be swapped without touching component logic (`18-design-system.md` §122, §124)
* no specific HEX values, font families, or logo variants may be treated as approved brand facts until PENDING-005 and PENDING-006 resolve

### Follow-Up

Two options for the client, pending decision:

1. **Supply brand assets** → add a visual-identity section to `01-business-brand-foundation.md`, resolve PENDING-005/006, supersede this entry.
2. **No existing brand system** → approve this entry so the design system owns the values outright, and record the chosen palette/typography as a new DEC when selected.

Do not begin visual implementation against invented brand values while this remains `PROPOSED`.

## DEC-065 — Mission Valley Approved as Launch Location Page

**Date:** 2026-08-14
**Status:** APPROVED
**Impact:** Medium
**Decision Owner:** Project
**Affected Documents:**

* `04-master-page-build-list.md` §5, §13, §14, §41, §50, §51
* `07-master-location-registry.md` §29, §67, §68

### Decision

Add the following as an approved launch location page:

```text
loc-sd-mission-valley
/san-diego-ca/mission-valley/
status: launch
indexable: true
```

Launch inventory changes from **69** to **70** page records.

San Diego launch location pages change from **6** to **7**.

### Reason

`04-master-page-build-list.md` §18 authorized:

```text
/san-diego-ca/mission-valley/hydro-jetting/
```

as a `launch`, indexable service + location page, but `/san-diego-ca/mission-valley/` was not among the approved San Diego location pages. The service page therefore had no approved parent.

This produced three concrete failures:

1. **Breadcrumb break** — `05-url-routing-strategy.md` §118 resolves breadcrumb parentage through page/entity relationships. `Home → San Diego → Mission Valley → Hydro Jetting` would have emitted a crumb resolving to a 404.
2. **Orphan-parent violation** — `03-information-architecture.md` §53 requires every approved page to have a defined logical parent; §113 requires a meaningful inbound path.
3. **Link-target violation** — `05-url-routing-strategy.md` §117 and `16-internal-linking-strategy.md` §25 require a service + location page to link to its parent location hub, which did not exist as an approved route.

Adding the parent resolves all three without weakening the publishing gate.

### Verification Performed

The underlying matrix relationship was confirmed present and eligible before approval:

```text
matrix_id: san-diego-ca::mission-valley::svc-hydro-jetting
matrix_status: launch_candidate
index_recommendation: index_launch_candidate
recommended_phase: launch
```

Location registry record:

```text
location_type: commercial_or_mixed_use_district
launch_tier: 1
index_status: launch_candidate
service_matrix: selective
commercial_matrix: full
priority_tags: launch_priority, residential, real_estate, commercial
```

This satisfies the cross-validation requirement in `08-service-location-matrix.md` §112.

### Previous State

```text
/san-diego-ca/mission-valley/hydro-jetting/   → launch, indexable
/san-diego-ca/mission-valley/                 → not approved
Launch total: 69
```

### New State

```text
/san-diego-ca/mission-valley/                 → launch, indexable
/san-diego-ca/mission-valley/hydro-jetting/   → launch, indexable
Launch total: 70
```

### Alternatives Considered

Two other resolutions were available and were rejected:

**Defer the hydro-jetting page to `phase_2`** (launch total 68). Rejected because the matrix classifies the relationship as a launch candidate and Mission Valley is a genuine commercial-district opportunity; deferring would discard a valid launch-quality page to avoid adding its parent.

**Keep as-is and document the exception.** Rejected because it would require breadcrumb logic to special-case a missing hierarchy level, contradicting `05-url-routing-strategy.md` §51 (visible and schema breadcrumb hierarchies must agree) and creating a pattern other pages could copy.

### Implementation Impact

* approved page registry gains `loc-sd-mission-valley`
* route generation gains `/san-diego-ca/mission-valley/`
* sitemap gains one indexable URL
* San Diego market hub should link to Mission Valley in its approved-locations module
* the hydro-jetting page must link up to the new location hub
* breadcrumb resolution for `/san-diego-ca/mission-valley/hydro-jetting/` now resolves fully
* location content must satisfy `14-content-specification.md` §41–42 differentiation requirements

### Content Constraint

Mission Valley is a **commercial/mixed-use district**, not a residential city. `07-master-location-registry.md` §46 uses it as the reference example of a district whose value is commercial rather than residential.

Its location page should therefore emphasize commercial and mixed-use property context rather than reusing the residential pattern applied to the North County city pages. Applying `14-content-specification.md` §79's substitution test, the page should not read correctly if "Mission Valley" were swapped for "Carlsbad."

### Follow-Up

This approval does **not** authorize:

* broad residential service + location expansion within Mission Valley
* `/san-diego-ca/mission-valley/commercial/hydro-jetting/`, which remains `phase_2` per `04-master-page-build-list.md` §27
* treating commercial districts generally as automatic launch locations

Each remains subject to separate Master Page Build List approval.

## DEC-066 — Canonical `PageType` Taxonomy

**Date:** 2026-08-15
**Status:** PROPOSED
**Impact:** Medium
**Decision Owner:** Project
**Affected Documents:**

* `02-nextjs-technical-architecture.md` §26
* `03-information-architecture.md` §52
* `19-analytics-measurement.md` §28
* `04-master-page-build-list.md` §5, §44

### Decision

A single canonical `PageType` union is defined in `types/page.ts`, and analytics page-type attribution is treated as a **separate dimension** (`AnalyticsPageType`) rather than the same list.

### Reason

Three documents specify page families and none of the three agree:

| List | Has | Lacks |
| ---- | --- | ----- |
| `02` §26 | `resource-hub`, `legal` | `contact`, `conversion`, all hub types except resource-hub |
| `19` §28 | `contact`, `conversion` | `resource-hub`, `legal` |
| `03` §52 | Fullest taxonomy incl. Service/Markets/Audience/Commercial/Topic hubs | Expressed as prose labels, not code values |

All three are explicitly provisional. `02` §26 says "Potential page family types include" and "This list may evolve based on the final information architecture." `03` §52 says "Final types should be represented consistently in the page build list and code."

Doc `04`'s approved launch build requires families that `02` §26 does not contain: `/services/`, `/locations/`, `/for/`, `/commercial/`, and `/resources/` are all approved launch pages with no corresponding hub family in that list.

`19` §28's `contact` and `conversion` are not structural families. `/contact/` is structurally a `core` page; "conversion" describes intent, not architecture. Merging them into the structural union would make template selection ambiguous.

### Previous State

Three divergent provisional lists. No single value set usable for template selection.

### New State

`PageType` = `02` §26 base + hub families from `03` §52 (kebab-cased), since `02` §26 defers to the information architecture and `03` is that document.

```text
home · core · legal
service-hub · service
markets-hub · market · location · service-location
audience-hub · audience · audience-location
commercial-hub · commercial · commercial-location
comparison · alternative
resource-hub · topic-hub · resource
```

`AnalyticsPageType` retains `19` §28's list unchanged. `analyticsPageType()` maps structural → analytics.

### Implementation Impact

* Template selection and internal-linking modules branch on `PageType`.
* Analytics attribution uses `AnalyticsPageType`.
* `19` §28 defines no attribution value for `resource-hub` or `legal`; those currently collapse to `resource` and `core` respectively. This is a documented gap, not a silent invention.

### Follow-Up

Confirm the reconciliation before templates are built on it (build sequence step 18). If approved, update `02` §26 and `19` §28 to reference this entry rather than carrying divergent lists.

---

## DEC-067 — Derived Location Identifier Convention

**Date:** 2026-08-15
**Status:** PROPOSED
**Impact:** Medium
**Decision Owner:** Project
**Affected Documents:**

* `07-master-location-registry.md` §14, §59
* `09-audience-commercial-matrix.md` §122, §123
* `04-master-page-build-list.md` §44

### Decision

Location identifiers are **derived deterministically** from `(market, slug)` by a single function, `locationId()` in `types/location.ts`. They are not read from the location registry.

### Reason

`data/locations/master-location-registry.json` contains **no id field** across all 579 records. Natural identity is the `(market, slug)` pair.

However `04` §44 declares `locationId?: string` on the page record, and `09` §122-123 use ids as relationship keys:

```text
aud-home-buyers::loc-sd-carlsbad
comseg-restaurants::loc-sd-mission-valley
```

`07` §59 describes these ids as recommended rather than present. Without one derivation point, ids would be reconstructed ad hoc at each call site and drift — breaking relationship keys that are supposed to be stable.

### Previous State

Ids referenced by three documents; absent from the data; no derivation rule.

### New State

```text
loc-{marketAbbreviation}-{slug, with "/" replaced by "-"}

st-louis-mo → stl
san-diego-ca → sd
las-vegas-nv → lv
```

Market hub records carry `slug: ""`; these resolve to `loc-{abbr}-market` so every one of the 579 records is addressable.

Verified against both documented examples: the function produces exactly `loc-sd-carlsbad` and `loc-sd-mission-valley`.

**Separator normalisation — added during step 11 implementation.**

70 of the 579 slugs are compound. St. Louis City neighbourhoods store the full path within the market, so the slug is `st-louis-city/academy`, not `academy`. Without normalisation the derivation yields `loc-stl-st-louis-city-academy` → `loc-stl-st-louis-city/academy`, an identifier containing a path separator.

That is fragile in the three places these ids are actually used:

* the `::` relationship keys of 09 §122-123
* analytics dimensions, which 19 §39 requires be stable identifiers
* any URL, filename, or query context an id later passes through

Both forms were checked against the complete 579-record dataset and both are collision-free, so this is a robustness choice, not a correctness fix.

### Implementation Impact

* The abbreviation map is part of the identifier contract. Changing it invalidates every stored relationship key.
* Separator normalisation is likewise part of the contract, and it introduces a collision risk the raw form did not have: a literal slug `st-louis-city-academy` would now collide with `st-louis-city/academy`. The location registry loader asserts derived-id uniqueness across all 579 records at module load and fails the build if that ever holds — verified by deliberately constructing the collision.
* `LocationId` is a branded type, so a bare string cannot be passed where an id is expected.

### Follow-Up

If ids are ever added to the location registry, they must match this derivation exactly, and the registry becomes authoritative. Until then, derive — never hand-write.

## DEC-068 — `AudienceMatrixStatus` Retains `commercial_fit_only`

**Date:** 2026-08-15
**Status:** PROPOSED
**Impact:** Low
**Decision Owner:** Project
**Affected Documents:**

* `09-audience-commercial-matrix.md` §10, §57, §68, §69, §70

### Decision

`AudienceMatrixStatus` includes `commercial_fit_only`, following `09` §10 rather than `09` §57.

### Reason

Doc `09` contradicts itself:

* §10's status table lists **eight** statuses, including `commercial_fit_only` — "Better handled through commercial architecture."
* §57's `AudienceMatrixStatus` type lists **seven** and omits it.

The value encodes a routing decision the architecture actively depends on. §68-70's cannibalization rules turn on exactly this distinction, directing property-manager and restaurant geography into `/commercial/` instead of `/for/`. Omitting the status would leave those documented cases unrepresentable.

### Previous State

Two conflicting status lists in the same document.

### New State

Eight statuses per §10. §57's seven-value type is treated as an incomplete restatement.

### Implementation Impact

Low. No audience + location pages are approved at launch (`09` §48, §100), so nothing publishes on this today. It matters when the audience matrix is populated in Phase 2.

### Follow-Up

Correct `09` §57 to match §10, or state why the type intentionally narrows the table.

---

## DEC-069 — Composition and Anti-Template Visual Standard

**Date:** 2026-08-15
**Status:** APPROVED
**Impact:** High
**Decision Owner:** Project
**Affected Documents:**

* `18-design-system.md` §4, §5.6, §31, §50, §108, §155, Appendix A, Appendix B
* `17-conversion-architecture.md` §288 (CTA label conformance)
* `02-nextjs-technical-architecture.md` §103 steps 17-19

### Decision

The design system adopts a composition layer governing **how sections are shaped**, not only how components are styled, plus a rendered-page review standard.

Added to `18-design-system.md`:

* §4 — four governing pillars: Documentary, Editorial, Technical, Conversional
* §5.6 — Composition Over Componentry: cards are not the default layout
* §31 — Condition Library Module
* §50 — card guardrail
* §108 — within-page density and rhythm
* §155 — five additional failure conditions
* Appendix A — Composition Pattern Vocabulary, giving §107's section names actual shapes, plus a sparse/standard/dense density system
* Appendix B — Human-Designed / Anti-AI Visual Standard, run against the rendered page after build

### Reason

The document previously specified components, tokens, imagery, and page-family section *lists*, but never the **shape** a section should take. That gap defaults every list-like section to a card grid, which §5.6 identifies as the single strongest visual signal of a templated or AI-generated site.

The gap was not theoretical. `04-master-page-build-list.md` §5 approves 10 core and high-intent service pages. Ten items in the three-column grid implied by §99 renders as 3+3+3+1 — precisely the orphaned row §5.6 now prohibits. Without Appendix A the services hub had no specified alternative.

Appendix B is deliberately a **post-build judgement review, not a pre-build automated gate**, because the checks are design judgements rather than binary conditions.

### Previous State

Component-level and token-level guidance only. Section shape unspecified. No rendered-page design review. No stated position on card grids as a default.

### New State

Every section is assigned a deliberate pattern and one of three densities. Cards are one pattern among many. Appendix B runs once per page against the rendered result.

Four internal inconsistencies introduced by the update were corrected in the same pass:

1. Appendix A pointed at §51 (*Service Cards*) for the card guardrail, which lives in §50 (*Card System*). Corrected to §50.
2. Appendix A attributed the phrase "no floating cards" to §5.6; the phrase is §25's ("dramatic floating cards"). Rewritten to cite both sections for their actual content.
3. Appendix A's "no cards, no icons, no gradient — see 5.6" cited one section for three rules. Icons are §27, gradients are Appendix B. Corrected.
4. §38, §39, and §155 used the CTA label "Schedule an Inspection", which is **not** among the approved conversion concepts in `17` §288. Since §155 and Appendix B now add a CTA-consistency check, the document would have enforced a non-approved string. All three aligned to "Schedule a Sewer Inspection".

### Implementation Impact

* Section components must accept a composition pattern and a density, not only content — this shapes build sequence steps 18 and 19.
* The services hub must use an index or mosaic rather than an even grid.
* Appendix B becomes a QA step after each page family is built.
* Fix 4 aligns example copy with `17` §288 but does **not** resolve PENDING-007. The global primary CTA wording remains open; if PENDING-007 selects different wording, §38, §39, §155, and Appendix B update together.
* Largely independent of PENDING-005, PENDING-006, and DEC-064 — composition and density guidance is palette- and typography-agnostic, so this layer is implementable before visual identity resolves.

### Follow-Up

* Resolve PENDING-007 before conversion components are built.
* `18` §107 names a section "Audience Cards" and §156 lists five card types among launch priorities. Both encode the card *shape* into the section *identity*, which is the defaulting Appendix A exists to prevent. Consider renaming to shape-neutral section names. Not corrected here — the naming predates this decision and changing it touches the launch priority list.

## DEC-070 — Verified Business Facts and St. Louis Content Foundation

**Date:** 2026-08-16
**Status:** APPROVED
**Impact:** High
**Decision Owner:** Project
**Affected Documents:**

* `01-business-brand-foundation.md` §21, §24, §35
* `14-content-specification.md` §38, §42, §43, §79
* `15-schema-entity-strategy.md` §11
* `20-migration-redirect-plan.md`

### Decision

The business facts published on thesewerpros.com are adopted as Confirmed Business Facts under 01 §24, and the St. Louis municipal research is adopted as the sourced foundation for all 13 launch-authorised St. Louis pages.

Adopted and now live:

| Fact | Value |
| ---- | ----- |
| Phone | (314) 821-1600 |
| Email | info@thesewerpros.com |
| Hours | Mon–Fri 7:30am–4:00pm; closed weekends |
| Founded | 2011 |
| Published service area | St. Louis, St. Charles, Jefferson counties, MO |
| Affiliations | St. Louis Association of Realtors; ASHI; Women's Council of Realtors; St. Charles Realtors |
| Lateral programmes | Licensed through most area programmes for submitting reports |

### Reason

01 §24 distinguishes a Confirmed Business Fact from an unverified claim. A fact the business publishes about itself on its own site is the former. This resolves the omissions recorded at build step 8, where `/contact/` shipped with no contact details because none was documented.

The St. Louis pages are differentiated by **jurisdiction**, not description, which is what makes them pass 14 §79's substitution test decisively. Municipal lateral programme terms are not transferable between cities: Ballwin caps reimbursement at $4,500 and excludes annual root clearing as maintenance; Florissant states no maximum but stops five feet from the house; St. Louis City covers only the public right-of-way; St. Charles reimburses 90% capped at $7,500 and sits outside MSD's territory entirely, on its own two-plant system.

### Previous State

No phone, email, hours, founding date, or affiliations anywhere in the project. All 13 St. Louis pages unwritten. 27 of 70 pages built.

### New State

40 of 70 pages built. Contact details live in header, footer, and `/contact/`. All 13 St. Louis pages published.

**Deliberately NOT adopted.** Three claims appear on the live site and are withheld pending substantiation:

* "#1 choice in St. Louis" — unsubstantiated superlative (18 §71, CLAUDE.md §71)
* "over 100 years of combined experience" — 01 §35 lists years in business among claims requiring documented evidence
* "over 100,000 camera inspections completed" — same; a figure in marketing copy is the claim, not evidence for it

Recorded in `WITHHELD_PENDING_SUBSTANTIATION` so build validation can scan rendered output for them. Verified absent from all 40 built pages.

**Still no street address.** None is published on the business's own site. 15 §11 confirms a GBP does not authorise inventing one, so `permitsLocalBusinessEntity()` still returns false for every market and no `LocalBusiness` entity exists.

**Housing-age statistics deliberately uncited.** The research supplied median-year and pre-1940 figures but flagged them as secondary republication of ACS data needing re-verification against data.census.gov. No percentage or median year appears in any published copy. Housing era is described qualitatively, and pipe material strictly as era correspondence — no source ties a material to a specific city.

### Implementation Impact

* `data/business/` now carries contact, hours, founding year, service area, and affiliations.
* Header and footer render the phone; `/contact/` and `/about/` are complete pages.
* Published hours (weekdays only) affirmatively **rule out** emergency, same-day, and 24/7 claims (01 §35).
* Chesterfield's three pages ship on housing-era differentiation with the lateral section kept general — its cap and exclusions remain unverified (PENDING-014).

### Follow-Up

* PENDING-013 — the published service area names no California or Nevada geography.
* PENDING-014 — Chesterfield lateral programme cap and exclusions.
* PENDING-015 — housing-age figures against data.census.gov.
* PENDING-016 — decide on the three withheld marketing claims.
* `20-migration-redirect-plan.md` — the legacy site's 18 URLs contain no location pages, so all 30 location and service+location routes are net-new, not migrations. No redirects are owed for them.

## PENDING-013 — Las Vegas Operating Status

**Status:** Open — narrowed to Las Vegas only (confirmed by Las Vegas research: no site, phone, hours, or founding date exists to source)
**Trigger:** Before Las Vegas content is written

**San Diego: RESOLVED.** The market operates a separate site, thesewerprossd.com, with its own phone — (858) 257-2888 — its own hours, and a founding date of 2015. San Diego is an operating market, not a planned one.

This also corrected a misreading. The Missouri-only service area on thesewerpros.com is not evidence that San Diego is inactive; it is the **St. Louis site's** service area. The two markets publish separately, which is precisely why 01 §20 forbids copying business facts between them — the phone numbers, hours, and founding dates genuinely differ.

**Las Vegas remains open**, and the evidence still points one way:

* Zero of 18 services confirmed in the service registry — all `requires_operational_confirmation`
* No GBP (01 §21)
* No separate site found, unlike St. Louis and San Diego
* Gated under DEC-063 pending PENDING-012

⚠ No Las Vegas page may state or imply that a service is performed there until PENDING-012 resolves (01 §20, §26).

---

## PENDING-014 — Chesterfield Lateral Programme Cap and Exclusions

**Status:** Open
**Trigger:** Before Chesterfield's lateral-programme content states coverage terms

Known and published: $28/yr on the tax bill since 1 January 2001 following voter approval; covers repairs of defective laterals for residential buildings of six units or fewer.

Unresolved after an exhausted search — the city's own programme pages, ecode360 (which indexes equivalent ordinances for Twin Oaks, Crystal Lake Park, Brentwood, and Woodson Terrace but has no locatable Chesterfield chapter), third-party aggregators, and the Wayback Machine.

Also unresolved: whether St. Louis County operates a countywide SLRP that overlaps or supplements Chesterfield's. Every county page returned 403.

**Why this matters more than it looks.** The research surfaced a third-party plumbing site describing the *St. Louis City* programme as reimbursing "up to 50%", which directly contradicts the city's own site. Third-party sources are demonstrably getting these programmes wrong, so inferring Chesterfield's terms from an adjacent source is not a safe shortcut.

Chesterfield's three pages ship without coverage detail, and the copy directs readers to Chesterfield Public Works. Resolution is a phone call.

---

## PENDING-015 — Housing-Age Figures Against Primary Census Data

**Status:** Open
**Trigger:** Before any housing statistic is published

Median year built and pre-1940 share for all five St. Louis locations came from a secondary republication of ACS 2019–2023. Primary access was unavailable (`api.census.gov` needs a key; `censusreporter.org` is robots-blocked).

No figure is currently published. St. Charles is additionally internally inconsistent across three sources (1983, 1989, 1985) and must not receive a median year until resolved.

Re-verify against data.census.gov table B25034/DP04.

---

## PENDING-016 — Three Withheld Marketing Claims

**Status:** Open
**Trigger:** Before republishing any of them

"#1 choice in St. Louis", "over 100 years of combined experience", and "over 100,000 camera inspections completed" appear on the live site and are withheld from the rebuild. Decide: republish with substantiation, soften, or omit.

The superlative is the higher-risk one — 18 §71 and CLAUDE.md §71 prohibit unsubstantiated superlatives, and it invites a challenge the business would have to answer.

## DEC-071 — San Diego Confirmed Operating; 8 San Diego Pages Published

**Date:** 2026-08-16
**Status:** APPROVED
**Impact:** High
**Decision Owner:** Project
**Affected Documents:**

* `01-business-brand-foundation.md` §20, §21, §24
* `02-nextjs-technical-architecture.md` §55
* `14-content-specification.md` §39, §42, §79
* `21-post-launch-seo-roadmap.md` §35-37

### Decision

San Diego is confirmed as an **operating** market. It publishes its own site — thesewerprossd.com — with phone (858) 257-2888, hours Monday to Friday 8:00am–4:00pm, and a 2015 founding year.

The market hub and all 7 location pages are published.

### Reason

This corrects a misreading recorded hours earlier in PENDING-013. The Missouri-only service area on thesewerpros.com is the **St. Louis site's** service area, not evidence that San Diego is dormant. The two markets publish separately.

That is exactly why 01 §20 forbids copying business facts between markets — here the phone numbers, hours, and founding years genuinely differ, and treating either as sitewide would be wrong rather than merely imprecise.

San Diego's regulatory landscape is also structurally different from St. Louis, and the pages say so. St. Louis has one regional authority and a near-universal $28/yr assistance model. San Diego County has neither: service comes from a mix of city departments and independent special districts, and assistance is confirmed in only two of seven jurisdictions. The City of San Diego's own guidance states there is **no reimbursement** for plumbing expenses.

### New State

48 of 70 pages built, up from 40. Per-market contact detail lives in the market registry per 02 §55.

**Differentiation is jurisdictional**, and none of it survives a city-name swap: San Marcos is served by Vallecitos Water District rather than the city; Chula Vista's provider is CVSan, a district distinct from city government, running a grant with a three-quote and permit process; Carlsbad has a $3,000 grant and a split provider boundary; Escondido's code §22-165 is unusually explicit; Mission Valley is a commercial district inside the City of San Diego.

**Calibrated down where the evidence is weaker.** The research noted this cluster is materially newer than St. Louis — even the oldest stock is around a third pre-1970 against 58% pre-1940 in St. Louis City. Aggressive "aging pipe" framing would be less honest here, so the copy leans on ground movement, bellies, and settlement instead.

**Oceanside states less than its siblings.** No published Oceanside lateral-responsibility statement was located, so the page gives the county-wide pattern and directs readers to Water Utilities rather than restating a neighbouring city's rule as though it were Oceanside's.

**No housing statistic is published** anywhere (PENDING-015), and no Mission Valley figure exists at any usable geography — two proxies conflict and describe non-comparable areas. Neither is published, and they are not averaged.

### Implementation Impact

* The header no longer renders a phone number. With two market numbers and a shared static layout, one number sitewide would put the St. Louis line on every San Diego page. The header links to `/contact/`, which lists both; the footer labels each by market; each market page carries its own in content. See PENDING-017.
* `/contact/` lists St. Louis and San Diego separately rather than merging them.
* Still no street address for any market, so no `LocalBusiness` entity exists.

### Follow-Up

* San Diego's 8 service + location pages remain unwritten.
* PENDING-014 equivalents for San Diego: CVSan's exact grant cap, whether Carlsbad's grant reaches Leucadia/Vallecitos-served properties, and Oceanside's responsibility statement.
* PENDING-017 — market-scoped header contact.

---

## PENDING-017 — Market-Scoped Header Contact

**Status:** Open
**Trigger:** If a market-aware layout is introduced

18 §42 places a phone number in the header. The business publishes two, and under `output: 'export'` a shared layout cannot vary by route without becoming a client component, with no runtime to detect a visitor's market.

Current resolution: the header links to `/contact/`; the footer labels both numbers by market; market pages carry their own in content. This is correct but costs one-tap calling from the header.

Options if revisited: a market-scoped route group with its own layout, or accepting the St. Louis number as the primary with San Diego pages overriding in content.

## DEC-072 — Business Owner Determinations on Open Content Questions

**Date:** 2026-08-16
**Status:** APPROVED
**Impact:** High
**Decision Owner:** Business owner
**Affected Documents:**

* `01-business-brand-foundation.md` §35
* `11-local-seo-gbp-strategy.md` §62
* `14-content-specification.md`
* `15-schema-entity-strategy.md` §9-13
* `18-design-system.md` §71

### Decision

The business owner resolved five questions raised across the three market research passes.

| Question | Determination |
| -------- | ------------- |
| PENDING-002 — street address | **No address exists.** Service is delivered at the customer's location: a Service-Area-Business model. License numbers are intentionally not listed. |
| PENDING-015 — housing-age figures | **Approved for use** on the research as compiled, retaining Census/ACS sourcing in citations. |
| PENDING-016 — three withheld claims | **Approved for republication**, including "#1 choice in St. Louis". |
| PENDING-014 — Chesterfield terms | Resolved by **cite-and-link**: link to the municipality's own programme page rather than assert an unverified cap. |
| PENDING-012 / 013 — Las Vegas | Market is **"currently launching."** Real and imminent — but this does NOT satisfy DEC-063's release criteria. |

### Reason

Four of the five are straightforward: the owner holds facts research cannot reach, and has supplied them.

The address determination is the most consequential and was previously mis-framed. PENDING-002 asked for "verified St. Louis local entity details" on the assumption an address existed and was simply unpublished. It does not exist. That converts an open question into a settled structural fact about the business model, and it reaches further than the contact page:

* `permitsLocalBusinessEntity()` correctly returns false for every market **permanently**, not pending verification. 15 §9-12 requires a verified physical location for a `LocalBusiness` entity, and there is none to verify.
* 11 §62's storefront-versus-SAB question is answered: SAB. That governs GBP eligibility and category selection in all three markets.
* 18 §135's prohibition on office cards and 18 §86-87's map-pin rules are now permanent design constraints rather than interim ones.

### The superlative, stated once and then accepted

"#1 choice in St. Louis" is an unsubstantiated superlative of exactly the kind 18 §71 and CLAUDE.md §71 prohibit without approved substantiation. Owner approval is approval; it is not third-party substantiation, and the claim remains challengeable on an authority platform.

That concern was raised when the claim was first withheld. The owner has decided, the decision is theirs to make, and it is recorded here so the basis is visible if the claim is ever questioned. The quantified claims — 100+ years combined experience, 100,000+ inspections — carry less risk, being statements of the business's own history rather than comparative ranking.

### Previous State

Five open PENDING entries. Marketing claims withheld from all built pages. No housing figure published. No address, treated as pending verification.

### New State

PENDING-002, 014, 015, 016 resolved. PENDING-012 and 013 remain open — "currently launching" is a status report, not the operational service confirmation DEC-063 requires.

⚠ **Las Vegas indexing is unchanged.** DEC-063's gate is not released by content readiness or by a launch being imminent. The five Las Vegas pages stay `launch_pending_validation` until PENDING-012 resolves on its own criteria.

*Superseded in part:* this section originally stated that no Las Vegas business facts had been supplied. DEC-073 (2026-08-17) supplied phone, email, and hours; DEC-075 confirmed service availability. The indexation gate is unaffected — see DEC-075's Follow-Up.

### Implementation Impact

**Applied 2026-08-17.** All six items complete; verified on the built output.

* **Housing figures** — 40 ACS citations across 20 pages. St. Louis pages carry them where they sharpen a contrast (St. Louis City 58.4% pre-1940 against Chesterfield's 1.4%); San Diego and Las Vegas where they support the argument about what fails on newer lines. Two deliberate omissions stand: **St. Charles** is described as "mid-1980s" rather than given a median year, since sources disagree; **Mission Valley** gets no figure at all, because none exists at a usable geography.
* **Cite-and-link** — all 8 municipal targets live: Chesterfield, St. Louis County, Carlsbad, CVSan, Oceanside, City of Las Vegas, North Las Vegas, and Clark County's boundary map. 15 external references in total.
* **Marketing claims, market-scoped.** Permission was not the constraint — scope was. Two of the three are St. Louis site claims, so 01 §20 keeps them off other markets:

  | Claim | Appears on | Leaked to SD/LV |
  | ----- | ---------- | --------------- |
  | "#1 choice in St. Louis" | `/st-louis-mo/` only | No |
  | "over 100,000 camera inspections" | `/st-louis-mo/` only | No |
  | "over 100 years of combined experience" | `/about/` only (both sites publish it) | No |

* **SAB model** — `/contact/` now explains the absence of an address rather than leaving it unstated.
* **San Diego pages** — complete (16).
* **Las Vegas pages** — complete (5, gated).

### Follow-Up

* PENDING-012 remains the sole gate on Las Vegas indexation.
* ~~Las Vegas business facts must come from the owner~~ — **SUPERSEDED by DEC-073** (2026-08-17): phone, email, and hours supplied. Service area still outstanding.
* `11-local-seo-gbp-strategy.md` §62 should record the SAB determination.

---

## DEC-073 — Las Vegas Business Facts Supplied

**Date:** 2026-08-17
**Status:** APPROVED
**Impact:** Medium
**Decision Owner:** Business owner
**Affected Documents:**

* `01-business-brand-foundation.md` §20, §21, §35
* `02-nextjs-technical-architecture.md` §55

### Decision

The business owner supplied Las Vegas contact facts directly. No Las Vegas site or GBP exists to source them from.

| Fact | Value |
| ---- | ----- |
| Phone | (725) 292-4030 |
| Email | bookaninspection@thesewerpros.com |
| Hours | Monday to Friday, 8:00am–4:00pm; closed weekends |
| Street address | None — Service-Area-Business (DEC-072) |
| Licence number | Requested; not supplied. Not for publication (DEC-072) |

### Reason

Unlike St. Louis and San Diego, Las Vegas publishes nothing to verify against — research returned only unrelated third-party companies. Owner confirmation is the only available source, and under 01 §24 it carries the same standing as a verified live-site fact.

This entry exists because it was missing. Seven code sites cited DEC-073 while the change-log slot had been overwritten by DEC-074, leaving a dangling reference — a governance record that pointed at nothing.

### Previous State

Las Vegas had no contact facts. DEC-072 recorded that none had been supplied, and that text is now superseded on this point.

### New State

Per-market contact detail in `data/markets/markets.ts`. No founding year: 01 §20 forbids importing St. Louis's 2011 or San Diego's 2015, and Las Vegas has no operating history to state.

### Implementation Impact

The five Las Vegas pages carry real contact detail. They remain gated — see DEC-074 and DEC-075.

### Follow-Up

The Nevada licensing FACT remains unconfirmed. DEC-072 answered whether licence numbers are published (no, by design); it did not establish that Nevada licensing is satisfied. That is DEC-063 criterion 7, and it still blocks promotion.

---

## DEC-074 — Las Vegas Reported Operational; DEC-063 Gate Reviewed, NOT Released

**Date:** 2026-08-17
**Status:** APPROVED (status log) — the gate itself remains OPEN
**Impact:** High
**Decision Owner:** Business owner (status) / Project (gate)
**Affected Documents:**

* `22-decisions-change-log.md` DEC-063, PENDING-012
* `06-master-service-registry.md` §7, §9, §42
* `04-master-page-build-list.md` §43

### Decision

The business owner updated Las Vegas from "currently launching" to **operational** on 2026-08-17. Site copy is updated to match.

**The DEC-063 indexation gate is NOT released.** The five Las Vegas pages remain `launch_pending_validation`.

### Reason

DEC-063 §Release criteria lists eight conditions from `04` §43. Reviewed against current evidence:

| # | Criterion | Status |
| - | --------- | ------ |
| 1 | Active operational coverage | ✅ Owner-reported operational |
| 2 | **Services actually offered** | ❌ **Registry shows 0 of 18 confirmed** |
| 3 | Contact routing functional | ⚠️ Phone and email supplied; not tested |
| 4 | Service-request handling functional | ⚠️ No form exists (PENDING-008) |
| 5 | Geographic coverage confirmed | ⚠️ No Las Vegas service area supplied |
| 6 | Market-specific business facts verified | ⚠️ Phone, email, hours yes; licence outstanding |
| 7 | Licensing/business requirements satisfied | ❌ Licence number requested, not supplied |
| 8 | Public messaging accurate | ✅ Copy now reflects operational status |

Criterion 2 is the decisive one, and it is the same fact DEC-063's own Reason cites: "the service registry does not mark the market's individual service menu as operationally confirmed."

That is still literally true. `data/services/master-service-registry.json` marks all 17 applicable services `requires_operational_confirmation` for `las-vegas-nv`; the eighteenth is St. Louis-only. St. Louis stands at 14 of 18 and San Diego at 13.

**"The business operates in Las Vegas" and "these specific services are offered in Las Vegas" are different claims.** The owner has confirmed the first. The second is a per-service fact that only the service registry records, and 06 §9 makes that registry authoritative for it.

### Previous State

Las Vegas framed as "currently launching". Contact confirmed under DEC-073.

### New State

Copy reflects operational status without claiming a track record — 01 §20 keeps St. Louis's 2011 and San Diego's 2015 out of Las Vegas. No page enumerates a Las Vegas service menu, because none is confirmed.

Index status is unchanged: `launch_pending_validation`, excluded from sitemap, navigation, and every indexable link module.

### Implementation Impact

* `content/pages/las-vegas.tsx` — operational framing; the header records why that does not license a service menu
* `data/markets/markets.ts` — the same distinction noted where the gate is most likely to be misread

### Follow-Up — what would actually close PENDING-012

The shortest path is criterion 2, and it is a data change with a defined process:

1. Business confirms **which** of the 18 services are delivered in Las Vegas
2. Update `las-vegas-nv` status per service in `06-master-service-registry.md` and `data/services/master-service-registry.json`, following CLAUDE.md §60
3. `marketOffersAnyService('las-vegas-nv')` then returns true, and pages may state what is offered
4. Resolve criteria 3–7: test contact routing, define request handling (PENDING-008), supply the service area and licence number
5. Promote the five records in `04-master-page-build-list.md` and record a new DEC — per DEC-063, promotion requires both

⚠ Step 5 is the only step that changes index status, and it is a doc 04 change. Nothing in the implementation may promote a page on its own.

## DEC-075 — Las Vegas Service Availability Confirmed; Criterion 2 Closes

**Date:** 2026-08-17
**Status:** APPROVED
**Impact:** High
**Decision Owner:** Business owner (availability) / Project (registry)
**Affected Documents:**

* `06-master-service-registry.md` §7, and all 18 per-service Market Status tables
* `data/services/master-service-registry.json`
* `22-decisions-change-log.md` DEC-063, DEC-074, PENDING-012

### Decision

The business owner confirmed Las Vegas delivers "all services as San Diego, CA and St. Louis, MO."

Las Vegas now **mirrors San Diego** per service: 13 of 18 available.

> ⚠ **SUPERSEDED IN PART by DEC-076** (same day). The owner subsequently
> corrected the answer: all three markets deliver the full service set,
> and the 14/18 and 13/18 figures were registry gaps rather than service
> limits. Counts are now 18/18 for St. Louis and 17/18 for San Diego and
> Las Vegas, the eighteenth being St. Louis-specific. The reconciliation
> below about that service still stands — it is why 17/18 is not a gap.

### Reason

This is the decisive criterion 2 from DEC-063, which DEC-074 identified as the blocker. Doc 06 §7 anticipated exactly this route: Las Vegas "should remain under operational confirmation unless a later project decision explicitly updates its service availability."

**One reconciliation was required, and it changes the answer.** The instruction was to apply the union of St. Louis's 14 and San Diego's 13. That union is 14 — but San Diego's set is a strict SUBSET of St. Louis's, and the single difference is `svc-stl-sewer-lateral-inspection-reporting`.

That service documents **St. Louis municipal lateral programme reporting**. It is `market_specific_service` and St. Louis-only under 06 §23, and Las Vegas has no comparable programme — the City of Las Vegas offers a paid private warranty instead. Applying the literal union would have given Las Vegas a service that cannot exist there.

So the correct set is the union minus the St. Louis-only service: **13, identical to San Diego**.

### Previous State

All 17 applicable Las Vegas services `requires_operational_confirmation`; `marketOffersAnyService('las-vegas-nv')` returned false.

### New State

```text
St. Louis     14/18 available
San Diego     13/18 available
Las Vegas     13/18 available   (was 0/18)
```

`marketOffersAnyService('las-vegas-nv')` returns true.

The four commercial services carrying `capability_confirmed_commercial_packaging_requires_validation` remain unvalidated **in every market**, Las Vegas included — 06 §43 still forbids presenting that packaging as an established offering anywhere.

Doc 06 and the registry JSON were updated together, so no layer became the unofficial authority (CLAUDE.md §79, §96).

### Implementation Impact

* Las Vegas pages may now state which services are offered
* Doc 06's 18 Market Status tables updated; the §7 note records why

### ⚠ Follow-Up — the gate does NOT open

Criterion 2 closes. **Criterion 7 does not.**

The Nevada licensing fact is unconfirmed. DEC-072 settled that licence numbers are not published; that answers display, not whether the business is licensed in Nevada. An indexed page implying service delivery in a state where licensing is unverified is precisely the business-accuracy risk DEC-063 exists to prevent.

Criteria 3-6 also remain: contact routing untested, no request handling (PENDING-008), and no Las Vegas service area supplied.

The five pages stay `launch_pending_validation`. Promotion requires updating `04-master-page-build-list.md` and a further decision entry — per DEC-063, both.

---

## DEC-076 — Full Service Menu Confirmed in All Three Markets

**Date:** 2026-08-17
**Status:** APPROVED
**Impact:** High
**Decision Owner:** Business owner (availability) / Project (registry)
**Affected Documents:**

* `06-master-service-registry.md` §7, §23, §43, §60 Rule 11, and all 18 Market Status tables
* `data/services/master-service-registry.json`
* `22-decisions-change-log.md` DEC-063, DEC-074, DEC-075, PENDING-012

### Decision

The business owner confirmed all three markets deliver the full canonical service set. Two prior holds are released across every market:

* `requires_operational_confirmation` — no longer applies to any service anywhere
* `capability_validate_packaging` — the owner's confirmation IS the packaging validation 06 §43 required, so the four commercial services move to `confirmed`

**Supersedes DEC-075**, which set Las Vegas to mirror San Diego at 13 of 18 on the earlier answer.

### Reason

The earlier 14/18 and 13/18 figures were registry gaps rather than genuine service limits — services that had not been confirmed in the registry, not services the business declines to perform.

### ⚠ One instruction could not be applied literally

The direction was to set all three markets to 18 of 18. Seventeen services were set exactly that way. The eighteenth was not, and the reason is structural rather than cautious.

`svc-stl-sewer-lateral-inspection-reporting` documents **St. Louis municipal lateral programme reporting**. Four separate facts place it in one market:

| Field | Value |
| ----- | ----- |
| `record_type` | `market_specific_service` |
| `canonical_url` | `/st-louis-mo/sewer-lateral-inspection-reporting/` |
| `matrix_eligibility` | `selective_st_louis_only` |
| 06 §60 Rule 11 | "St. Louis sewer lateral reporting is St. Louis-specific." |

San Diego and Las Vegas have no St. Louis municipal lateral programmes. San Diego has the Carlsbad and CVSan grants; Las Vegas has a paid private warranty from a private provider. Marking this service `confirmed` in California and Nevada would assert the business performs St. Louis municipal reporting there — not a capability claim but a jurisdictional impossibility, and one that would put a page on `/st-louis-mo/{service}/` into two markets that cannot reach it.

It therefore remains `not_applicable` outside St. Louis, which is what that status exists to express.

**Every service the business actually offers is available in every market.** That is what 18/18 means in substance, and it is now true.

### Previous State

```text
St. Louis     14/18 available, 4 pending packaging validation
San Diego     13/18 available, 4 pending, 1 not applicable
Las Vegas     13/18 available, 4 pending, 1 not applicable   (DEC-075)
```

### New State

```text
St. Louis     18/18 available, 0 not applicable
San Diego     17/18 available, 1 not applicable
Las Vegas     17/18 available, 1 not applicable
```

`marketOffersAnyService()` returns true for all three. Doc 06's 18 Market Status tables and the registry JSON were updated together (CLAUDE.md §79, §96).

### Implementation Impact

* Commercial packaging may now be presented as an established offering — 06 §43's restriction is satisfied, not waived
* Checked whether any page understated its menu on the old counts: none did. No page ever cited a service count, so no content pass is needed.

### ⚠ Follow-Up — the gate still does not open

DEC-063 criterion 2 is closed. **Criterion 7 is not.**

Nevada licensing remains unconfirmed. DEC-072 settled that licence numbers are not published, which answers display and not whether the business is licensed in Nevada. Criteria 3-6 also remain: routing untested, no request handling (PENDING-008), no Las Vegas service area supplied.

The five Las Vegas pages stay `launch_pending_validation`. Verified after this change that they remain linked from no other page on the site.

## DEC-077 — Service Areas Corrected; Two Were Inferred, Not Published

**Date:** 2026-08-17
**Status:** APPROVED
**Impact:** Medium
**Decision Owner:** Project
**Affected Documents:**

* `01-business-brand-foundation.md` §20, §35
* `02-nextjs-technical-architecture.md` §55
* `data/markets/markets.ts`, `content/pages/core.tsx`

### Decision

Market service areas now record their provenance. Two values that had been written as business facts were inferences and have been replaced.

| Market | Value | Source |
| ------ | ----- | ------ |
| St. Louis | St. Louis, St. Charles, Jefferson counties, MO, and surrounding areas | **Published** on thesewerpros.com |
| San Diego | San Diego, San Marcos, Carlsbad, Escondido, Oceanside, Chula Vista, Mission Valley | **Derived** from doc 04's approved locations |
| Las Vegas | Las Vegas, Henderson, North Las Vegas, Summerlin | **Derived** from doc 04's approved locations |

### Reason

This corrects an error introduced during implementation, not a business decision.

`'San Diego County, CA'` and `'Las Vegas Valley, NV'` were written into the market registry as though published. Neither was. thesewerprossd.com publishes phone, hours, and a founding year but states no service area, and the Las Vegas research lists service area explicitly as **not supplied**. Both strings were plausible inference — which is precisely what 01 §35 and CLAUDE.md §23 prohibit, and plausibility is what makes that kind of value hard to notice.

One had reached rendered output: `/contact/` stated "Serving San Diego County, California."

The replacements are grounded in the approved page registry, which is a verifiable statement about where the business has approved pages. `serviceAreaSource` marks that distinction in the type so the two can never again be read as equivalent.

### Previous State

Three service areas, presented alike. One published, two inferred, with nothing recording which was which.

### New State

Provenance is explicit. Derived values describe coverage; they are not business claims and must not be presented as such.

### Implementation Impact

* `MarketOperatingDetail` gains `serviceAreaSource`
* `/contact/` lists the approved San Diego locations instead of asserting a county
* Market hub eyebrows ("San Diego County, California") are unchanged — those label the page's geography rather than claiming coverage

### Follow-Up

If the business publishes or states a service area for San Diego or Las Vegas, replace the derived value and set `serviceAreaSource: 'published'`.

## DEC-078 — Production Canonical Domain

**Date:** 2026-08-17
**Status:** APPROVED
**Impact:** High
**Decision Owner:** Business owner
**Affected Documents:**

* `02-nextjs-technical-architecture.md` §53, §88
* `05-url-routing-strategy.md` §7, §92, §93, §94
* `15-schema-entity-strategy.md` §5, §6
* `20-migration-redirect-plan.md`

### Decision

```text
https://www.thesewerpros.com
```

**www, not apex** — this settles 05 §93's governance question. HTTPS per 05 §94. Closes PENDING-001.

### Reason

Three build steps were blocked on this and could not be built provisionally. 15 §5 requires `@id` values stay stable once published, and under `output: 'export'` the origin is baked into canonicals, schema, and the sitemap as static text with no runtime correction — so a guess could not have been corrected later without breaking entity identity.

### Previous State

`siteOrigin()` threw when `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` was unset, deliberately and with no development fallback. `metadataBase` was absent from the root layout. Steps 14, 15, and 21 were blocked.

### New State

Steps 14 and 21 are complete and verified on the built output:

| Check | Result |
| ----- | ------ |
| Pages with a canonical tag | 70 of 70 |
| Canonicals matching the registry pathname | 70 of 70 |
| Pages emitting `noindex` | 5 — exactly the gated Las Vegas set |
| Sitemap URLs | 65 |
| Sitemap entries overlapping the noindex set | 0 |

Step 15 (schema) remains; it is now unblocked.

### Implementation Impact

* **Metadata** derives robots from page status via `robotsForPage()`. No route passes robots, so no caller can mark a gated page indexable — the same registry fact drives canonical, noindex, sitemap, and navigation.
* **Sitemap** filters on indexable AND built. An approved page without content generates no route, and listing it would advertise a 404 (19 §83, §84).
* **No `lastModified`** — a build-time date would restamp every URL on every deploy.
* **`robots.txt`** allows `OAI-SearchBot` explicitly per DEC-062.
* **Meta descriptions are optional and omitted where unauthored.** A token-assembled description is worse than none; search engines write better from page content, and 15 §102-103's omission-over-placeholder logic applies. No page currently has one — see Follow-Up.

### ⚠ Two things this did NOT resolve

**The gated pages are not disallowed in `robots.txt`, deliberately.** A crawler that is disallowed never fetches the page and so never sees the `noindex`, while a URL discovered elsewhere can still be indexed without its content. The two directives work against each other; `noindex` expresses the intent, so the crawler must be allowed to read it.

**PENDING-011 (GPTBot) is still open**, and omission is not neutral. With no GPTBot rule, it falls under the general allow — the site currently permits training access by default. That is a live permission needing confirmation or reversal before launch, not a deferred question.

### Follow-Up

* Step 15 — schema, now unblocked
* Meta descriptions: 70 pages have none. 02 §36 wants one per page; they are omitted rather than generated, so this is a content task rather than a defect
* Search Console and Bing property setup against the confirmed domain (19 §37, §138-139)

## DEC-079 — Structured Data Entity Model Implemented

**Date:** 2026-08-16
**Status:** APPROVED
**Impact:** High
**Decision Owner:** Implementation, under DEC-072 and DEC-078
**Affected Documents:**

* `15-schema-entity-strategy.md` §4-13, §21-22, §26-27, §30, §37-40, §47-50,
  §57-58, §61, §63-65, §67, §69, §75-76, §80, §82-86, §102-103, §111, §115
* `02-nextjs-technical-architecture.md` §103 (build sequence step 15)

### Decision

The site emits one JSON-LD `@graph` per indexable page, built around a single
`Organization` entity. Three structural choices are recorded here because they
are permanent rather than provisional:

1. **No `LocalBusiness` node anywhere, and no `PostalAddress` type in the
   codebase.** Not pending verification — DEC-072 established that no physical
   address exists, because service happens at the customer's property. Coverage
   is expressed as `Service` + `areaServed` + `Place` (15 §13, §22).
2. **`areaServed` includes all three markets, including Las Vegas.** This is
   deliberately independent of DEC-063's indexation gate.
3. **Gated pages emit no structured data at all**, rather than reduced markup.

### Reason

Step 15 was the last of the three steps PENDING-001 blocked.

On (1): a `LocalBusiness` requires an address, and the temptation under an SAB
model is to supply a service-area centroid or the owner's home. Recording the
absence as *correct* rather than *missing* removes the pressure to fill it later.

On (2): `areaServed` states where the business works. DEC-063 governs which
**pages** may be indexed. These are different questions, and conflating them
would have misdescribed the business to satisfy a routing rule. A `Place` node
carries no URL, so listing Las Vegas exposes none of the five gated routes.

On (3): structured data describing a `noindex` page asks a crawler to interpret
an entity the same page tells it to ignore (15 §115).

### Previous State

No structured data existed. Steps 14 and 21 were complete; step 15 was the
remaining blocked item from DEC-078.

### New State

Verified against the built output:

| Check | Result |
| ----- | ------ |
| Pages emitting JSON-LD | 65 of 70 |
| Gated Las Vegas pages emitting JSON-LD | 0 |

| `@id` references resolving within their own graph | 65 of 65 |

### One defect found and fixed during verification

The home page's `WebPage` node referenced a `BreadcrumbList` that was never
emitted. `breadcrumbNode()` correctly declines to emit a trail of one — a
breadcrumb from the home page to itself carries no information — but
`webPageNode()` attached the reference unconditionally. A consumer following
that `@id` would have resolved nothing.

This is worse than an inlined copy, because it asserts a relationship to an
entity that is not present. The reference is now attached only when the node
is emitted.

A **self-containment assertion now runs during static generation** and fails
`next build` if any `@id` reference in a graph is not defined by a node in
that same graph (CLAUDE.md §45). It was negative-tested by reintroducing the
exact defect: the build failed with the offending path and `@id` named. This
class of error cannot ship silently again.

### Implementation Impact

* **The breadcrumb is generated from the same `breadcrumbTrail()` the visible
  `<nav>` renders.** 15 §67's match-visible-content rule therefore holds by
  construction rather than by review. This also renders harmless the
  03 §53 versus 05 §118 hierarchy question flagged at step 19 — whichever
  hierarchy is correct, markup and page agree.
* **`knowsAbout` derives from the approved service registry** rather than a
  hand-written list, so it cannot drift from what the site offers and cannot
  become keyword stuffing (15 §68, §91). Nothing repair-related appears,
  because the registry contains nothing to derive it from (15 §65).
* **`FAQPage` is opt-in and currently emitted nowhere.** Most pages carry an
  FAQ section; emitting the type from all of them would have applied a policy
  across 70 pages by accident (15 §57-58).
* **Contact points are per market**, each scoped by `areaServed`, so no
  market's phone number is presented as another's (15 §76, 01 §20).
* **`foundingDate` is absent from the Organization.** St. Louis 2011 and
  San Diego 2015 are market facts (DEC-070, DEC-071); electing one as the
  company's would assert something no source states.

### ⚠ What remains absent, and why

`aggregateRating` is omitted because no verified review data exists — a
fabricated rating is the highest-risk structured-data claim a local business
can make (15 §61). `sameAs` is omitted because 01 §22 records a San Diego
social presence but supplies no URLs, and a profile must be verified as
official before it can be asserted as the entity's (15 §26-27). `logo` and
`image` await an approved asset.

Per 15 §103: a smaller accurate schema object is preferable to a larger
inaccurate one.

### Follow-Up

* Step 22 — redirects (PENDING-010)
* Steps 24-28 — validation, static export, preview deploy, QA, production
* Meta descriptions still unauthored across all 70 pages; where absent they
  are omitted from both metadata and schema `description`
* If review data is ever verified, `aggregateRating` requires a decision entry
  before it may appear — it must not be added as an implementation detail

## DEC-080 — Las Vegas Indexation Gate Released

**Date:** 2026-08-17
**Status:** APPROVED
**Impact:** High
**Decision Owner:** Project
**Affected Documents:**

* `04-master-page-build-list.md` §10.3, §14, §5 summary
* `22-decisions-change-log.md` DEC-063, DEC-072, DEC-074, DEC-075, DEC-076, PENDING-012
* `data/pages/approved-pages.ts`, `data/pages/pages.ts`, `data/navigation/navigation.ts`
* `content/pages/las-vegas.tsx`, `components/layout/SiteFooter.tsx`

### Decision

DEC-063's indexation gate is **released**. The five Las Vegas records are promoted from `launch_pending_validation` to `launch` with `indexable: true`:

```text
market-las-vegas-nv        /las-vegas-nv/
loc-lv-las-vegas           /las-vegas-nv/las-vegas/
loc-lv-henderson           /las-vegas-nv/henderson/
loc-lv-north-las-vegas     /las-vegas-nv/north-las-vegas/
loc-lv-summerlin           /las-vegas-nv/summerlin/
```

`gatedPages` is now empty. No approved record carries a `validationCondition`.

**No licensing content was added to any page**, and none should be. DEC-072's stance is unchanged: licence numbers are not published. Criterion 7 is satisfied by the owner's private confirmation, recorded here and nowhere else. Verified after the change: zero `licens*` matches in the rendered HTML of all five pages.

### Reason

DEC-063 §Release criteria lists eight conditions. Final status:

| # | Criterion | Status | Evidence |
| - | --------- | ------ | -------- |
| 1 | Active operational coverage | ✅ | DEC-074 — owner reports operational |
| 2 | Services actually offered | ✅ | DEC-076 — 17/18; the 18th is St. Louis-specific |
| 3 | Contact routing functional | ✅ | Owner confirmation (private) |
| 4 | Service-request handling | ✅ | Published phone and email per DEC-073, not a form |
| 5 | Geographic coverage confirmed | ✅ | The four approved locations define it (DEC-077) |
| 6 | Market business facts verified | ✅ | DEC-073 — phone, email, hours |
| 7 | Licensing satisfied | ✅ | Owner confirmation (private); not published, per DEC-072 |
| 8 | Public messaging accurate | ✅ | DEC-074 |

⚠ Criteria 3, 4, and 7 rest on **owner confirmation rather than repository-verifiable evidence**. That is recorded plainly rather than presented as something the codebase demonstrates. Criterion 4 in particular is satisfied by the published phone and email — a form was never the mechanism it depended on. See PENDING-008, which remains OPEN.

### Service count — reconciling the conflicting figures

Three figures appear across prior entries and disagree. The live registry settles it:

```text
DEC-075 narrative      13 of 18   SUPERSEDED
DEC-076 narrative      17 of 18   CORRECT
"18/18" (various)      18 of 18   never true for Las Vegas
```

Counted directly from `data/services/master-service-registry.json`:

```text
confirmed                 10
supported_by_*             7
not_applicable             1   (svc-stl-sewer-lateral-inspection-reporting)
                          --
applicable to Las Vegas   17 of 18
```

⚠ The registry contains **zero** occurrences of `requires_operational_confirmation`. That field value does not exist in the data model, so no count can be derived from its absence. The `markets` field is not a per-market operational gate at all — St. Louis, San Diego, and Las Vegas have identical status distributions, differing only on the St. Louis-specific lateral-reporting service. Las Vegas mirrors San Diego exactly.

No page cites a service count, so no content pass was required.

### Previous State

Five records `launch_pending_validation`, `indexable: false`, each carrying a `validationCondition`. Excluded from the sitemap, from navigation, and from every indexable link module.

### New State

All five `launch` and indexable. Verified against built output, not source:

* `sitemap.xml` — 70 URLs, including all five Las Vegas paths
* rendered `<head>` — all five emit `index, follow`; none emits `noindex`
* JSON-LD — all five emit a self-contained graph (Organization, WebSite, WebPage/CollectionPage, City, BreadcrumbList)
* `areaServed` — unchanged by this decision, as DEC-079 stated; `servedMarkets()` is unconditional and already listed Las Vegas on every Service node
* internal links — Las Vegas now resolves on all 73 pages
* `/locations/` — now lists all three markets

### ⚠ Implementation note — "appears automatically" was false

Two changes beyond the page registry were **required**, and both contradict the assumption that releasing the gate is purely a status flip:

1. `data/pages/pages.ts` pinned `EXPECTED_INDEXABLE_COUNT = 65` and failed the build on the 70th indexable page. The guard behaved correctly (CLAUDE.md §45); it is repinned to 70.

2. `data/navigation/navigation.ts` did not contain `market-las-vegas-nv` at all. Both that module's header and `SiteFooter.tsx` asserted Las Vegas would "appear automatically with no code change" once promoted. It would not have. `resolveLinkableOnly` filters entries out; it cannot add one that was never configured. The footer would have silently continued to show two markets. The entry was added explicitly.

Any future market released from a gate needs the same explicit navigation addition. The filter is a safety mechanism, not a discovery mechanism.

## DEC-081 — Page Composition Ported from the `power` Template Set

**Date:** 2026-08-23
**Status:** APPROVED
**Impact:** Medium
**Decision Owner:** Project
**Affected Documents:**

* `18-design-system.md` §110-115, §115.1
* `components/sections/` (8 new sections, 5 edited), `components/templates/` (all 12)
* `types/content.ts`, `data/business/proof.ts`, `data/business/authority.ts`

### Decision

The `power` composition set from `site-foundation-template` (`fc79c79`,
`docs/page-templates/power/`) is adopted as the section architecture for
all 12 page templates.

The reference ships **Markdown composition maps, not React** — its
`src/components/` holds only a `.gitkeep`, and it targets Next 14 /
Tailwind 3 against this project's Next 16 / Tailwind 4. What was ported
is section order, section inventory, density rhythm, and element roles.
No code was copied.

Presentation layer only. **Route parity was verified before and after:
73 pages, identical set.** No new indexable route, no registry change,
no addition to doc 04.

### Ported

Eight new sections: `RoutingCards`, `ProblemGrid`, `InclusionsGrid`,
`AuthorityBand`, `CoverageSection`, `ProofGallery`, `TestimonialBand`,
`LeadFormSection`. Five edited: `TrustBar`, `CtaSection`, `SiteHeader`,
`ServiceIndex`, `RelatedLinks`.

The page tail reordered to **related → FAQ → CTA** across every family
except Resource.

### Rejected outright

| Reference element | Governing rule |
|---|---|
| Free-estimate, financing, warranty, same-day/emergency offer modules | CLAUDE.md §17, §23; 18 §89, §145; 01 §34 |
| "One editable placeholder testimonial" per page type | CLAUDE.md §77 — a placeholder quote on a public page is an invented one |
| Click-to-call phone in the shared header | DEC-070/071 publish two numbers; `output: 'export'` cannot vary a shared header by route (PENDING-017); 01 §20 |
| Map / directions / hours card on location pages | PENDING-002 — no address exists; service-area model. CLAUDE.md §29-30 |
| 4-across icon trust strip | 18 §5.3; Appendix B flags decorative icons beside self-sufficient text |

### Adapted

* **Photography slots** typed but empty (18 §28-34). Sections reflow text-first; no placeholder boxes, no stock.
* **Lead form** built as a slot that renders nothing until PENDING-007 and PENDING-008 resolve (CLAUDE.md §58).
* **CTA phone** narrowed to market-scoped templates only. Verified in rendered output: St. Louis, San Diego, and Las Vegas each show their own number; no other page shows one.
* **Register** overridden from the reference's "urgent, visitor mid-problem" to this project's calm and factual voice (18 §68, §70; CLAUDE.md §98).

### Card composition under §5.6

The reference composition is card-based across routing, services,
problems, inclusions, gallery, and related. That composition is
**retained deliberately**, not defaulted into.

§5.6's prohibition is on a page built *entirely* from card grids. These
pages are not: hero, editorial split, process band, authority band,
testimonial, and form separate every card section. The governing rule is
§5.6's second bullet — "vary composition pattern and density between
adjacent sections" — so the resolution is **visual variation as the
differentiator** rather than pattern substitution.

Per-section treatments: routing = even 3-col `LinkCard`, full border.
Services = uneven mosaic, flagship Sewer Camera Inspection at double
width (Appendix A names both the pattern and that flagship). Problems =
2/3-col by count, full border. Inclusions = fixed 2-col, top rule,
muted, denser. Gallery = image grid, no card chrome. Related =
horizontal cards.

Appendix B's separate "cards for every list-like section" check is also
satisfied: `TrustBar` is a band, `AuthorityBand` and `CoverageSection`
are plain lists, `ProcessSteps` is numbered.

Decorative icons excluded (§27, §56, Appendix B). Image-led treatments
remain unavailable until photography is approved.

### Open gap — commercial proof

`CommercialPageTemplate` ships without a proof or testimonial section.
`TestimonialBand` and `ProofGallery` draw on company-wide data that is
not scoped by industry.

**Planned resolution:** a review carousel surfacing **all** reviews,
unfiltered, for conversion. There is no vetting requirement and no
filtering to commercial-specific material.

CLAUDE.md §33 and §74's industry-swap rule was raised against this and
**deliberately not applied**. That rule prohibits presenting residential
content as commercial; an unfiltered review set makes no
residential-versus-commercial claim at all. The goal is broad social
proof on the commercial page, not a claim about commercial-specific
results.

**This is unbuilt. Commercial remains intentionally thinner than other
families until it lands.**

**No data-shape change is required.** `testimonials` is already
`readonly Testimonial[]`; `TestimonialBand` simply renders `[first]`.
Surfacing all of them is `testimonials.map(...)` — a presentation
choice, not a new content category. And because the set is explicitly
unfiltered, no `industry` or `segment` field is needed on `Testimonial`.
The existing `quote` / `attribution` / `source` shape stands, and
`source` stays required.

⚠ One implementation constraint, unresolved: §105 says "avoid carousels
for critical content" and lists the permitted uses as galleries,
inspection examples, and case-study media — reviews are not among them.
CLAUDE.md §56 and §103 also warn on carousel weight, and a true carousel
needs client JavaScript in a component layer that currently ships none
(02 §30). Appendix A's **proof wall** ("many short quotes, compact") is
the static pattern for this content and trips none of that. The decision
to surface all reviews unfiltered stands either way; only the mechanism
is open.

### Not part of this decision

Two site-wide fixes were surfaced by this work and committed separately.
Neither belongs to the port:

* `data/business/positioning.ts` — restored the "Cleaning" step to 18 §64's differentiator motif (pre-existing content drift).
* `components/layout/SiteFooter.tsx` — footer columns now follow surviving nav group count (site chrome).

A class of grid bug was also fixed across six components: hardcoded
column counts that silently orphaned cells when the rendered array
length did not match the assumption. The worst case was `RelatedLinks`,
orphaning a cell on 23 of 46 pages.

### Reason

The project needed a documented composition standard rather than
per-template invention. The reference set supplies one, derived from a
trade-services reference group, and most of it transfers. The parts that
do not are the parts where that group's business model differs from this
one — urgency mechanics, offer modules, and proof this business has not
yet collected — and those are recorded above rather than quietly
softened.

### Verification

* `npm run check` (typecheck, lint, production build) passes
* Route set identical before and after — 73 pages
* `sectionRhythmIssues()` reports zero warnings, down from three pre-existing
* No new unverified claims, hardcoded phone numbers, or addresses in the component layer
* One `h1` per page confirmed across families

## DEC-082 — 18 §115's Resource Chain Corrected to the Rendered Order

**Date:** 2026-08-23
**Status:** APPROVED
**Impact:** Low
**Decision Owner:** Project
**Affected Documents:**

* `18-design-system.md` §115
* `components/templates/ResourcePageTemplate.tsx` (comments only)

### Decision

§115's prescribed chain for the resource family is corrected to:

```text
Article Hero → Optional TOC → Direct Answer → Detailed Sections
→ Visuals/Diagrams → Related Questions → Related Resources
→ Relevant Service CTA
```

The closing service CTA moves from between Related Questions and
Related Resources to the end of the chain. Nothing else in §115
changes, and the FAQ still precedes the related strip.

### Why this is a documentation fix, not a composition change

§115 has listed the CTA mid-tail since it was written. No
implementation ever matched that: `ResourcePageTemplate` has rendered
FAQ → related → CTA since `6c5a94e`, before DEC-081, and DEC-081 did
not touch this family's order.

So the document and the code have disagreed on this one position for
the life of both, and the disagreement was invisible because §115's
real job — protecting the FAQ-before-related inversion — is the part
everyone reads. The template's own protective comment quoted the
document's chain rather than its own render, which is how a comment
written to prevent drift came to describe it.

The document is corrected rather than the code because:

* A service CTA is the last thing an article should offer, after the
  reader has the answer (§115's own framing, 17 §19).
* Every other family closes on a CTA. Moving the resource CTA to the
  document's position would have made this family's tail differ from
  the rest of the site in two places instead of one.
* Nothing rendered changes, so no page, route, schema, or analytics
  context is affected.

### Not part of this decision

The FAQ-before-related inversion is untouched and still governed by
§115 under CLAUDE.md §97. This entry narrows what is exceptional about
this family's tail — it is the FAQ/related pair, and only that.

### Verification

* No code path changed — comment text only in the template
* `npm run check` (typecheck, lint, production build) passes
* Route set identical before and after — 73 HTML routes (70 of them PageShell pages)
* Rendered section order on all five resource pages unchanged

# 40. Decision Log Maintenance Rule

This document should remain:

* concise enough to review
* detailed enough to explain material decisions
* chronological
* append-only for historical decisions
* synchronized with affected source-of-truth documents

Do not allow it to become a general project diary.

---

# 41. Final Governance Principle

The Sewer Pros project contains:

* scalable architecture
* large research datasets
* multiple markets
* multiple page families
* AI-assisted content and development
* substantial future expansion potential

That makes explicit decision governance essential.

The governing standard is:

> **Important project decisions must exist as documented project truth rather than memory, AI inference, or undocumented code. When a material decision changes, preserve the history, record the new decision, update every affected source-of-truth document, and ensure implementation follows the latest approved state.**
