# The Sewer Pros — Audience & Commercial Matrix

**Document:** `09-audience-commercial-matrix.md`
**Project:** The Sewer Pros Website Rebuild
**Repository:** `the-sewer-pros-site`
**Status:** Active Audience & Commercial Opportunity Authority
**Document Role:** Audience taxonomy, commercial-segment taxonomy, audience-to-service relationships, audience-to-location relationships, commercial-to-service relationships, and commercial-to-location opportunity governance
**Primary Markets:** St. Louis, MO; San Diego, CA; Las Vegas, NV

---

# 1. Purpose

This document defines how The Sewer Pros website should model:

* customer audiences
* referral audiences
* property-management audiences
* commercial customer segments
* audience-to-service relationships
* audience-to-location relationships
* commercial-segment-to-service relationships
* commercial-segment-to-location relationships
* audience page opportunities
* audience + location opportunities
* commercial page opportunities
* commercial + location opportunities
* conversion pathways
* publishing priorities
* matrix eligibility
* page-generation safeguards

This document answers:

> **Who does The Sewer Pros serve, which services matter to each audience, where does geographic targeting make sense, and which commercial segments deserve dedicated acquisition pathways?**

This document does **not** independently authorize every potential page.

Production publication and indexation remain controlled by:

`04-master-page-build-list.md`

This matrix may support research, prioritization, templates, drafts, candidate routes, and protected-preview QA before a relationship is selected for production.

---

# 2. Core Matrix Principle

The website should not treat every:

```text
Audience
×
Location
```

or:

```text
Commercial Segment
×
Location
×
Service
```

combination as a page.

The matrix exists to model opportunity.

The governing rule is:

```text
Relationship
≠
Production Page
```

and:

```text
Audience Relevance
≠
Automatic Production or Indexation
```

---

# 3. Governing Document Relationship

```text
01-business-brand-foundation.md
↓
Defines who the company serves and its positioning

06-master-service-registry.md
↓
Defines canonical services

07-master-location-registry.md
↓
Defines canonical geographies

09-audience-commercial-matrix.md
↓
Defines audience/commercial relationships

04-master-page-build-list.md
↓
Tracks lifecycle, production publication, and indexation

05-url-routing-strategy.md
↓
Defines stable pathnames and canonical production routes
```

# 3A. Build-First Matrix Model

The audience and commercial matrices should accelerate development without turning every relationship into a public page.

Matrix data may be used to:

* identify audience and commercial opportunities
* prioritize page families
* create reusable templates
* draft audience-specific or commercial-specific content
* generate bounded candidate-route sets for local development
* build protected-preview pages for review
* plan internal links, schema, conversion paths, and analytics context
* compare opportunities before production selection

The system must keep four concepts separate:

```text
MATRIX STATUS
How strong or useful the relationship appears.

BUILD STATUS
Whether the associated content or implementation is a candidate, draft, build-ready, in QA, or complete.

PUBLICATION STATUS
Whether the page is deliberately included in production.

INDEXATION STATUS
Whether a published page is indexable or intentionally noindex.
```

The exact lifecycle values must match `04-master-page-build-list.md`. Matrix scores and eligibility labels do not substitute for publication or indexation state.

Ordinary development does not require a new approval entry. Business claims, services, markets, operational coverage, and production exposure still require verified source data and the appropriate documented decision.

---

# 4. Audience vs Commercial Segment

The project distinguishes between:

## Audience

A person, role, referral source, or decision-maker.

Examples:

* Home Buyer
* Real Estate Agent
* Property Manager
* Facility Manager

## Commercial Segment

A property type, business environment, operating context, or commercial vertical.

Examples:

* Restaurant / Food Service
* Multifamily
* Hospitality
* Retail
* HOA Community

These concepts may overlap.

For example:

```text
Property Manager
```

is primarily an audience.

```text
Multifamily Property
```

is primarily a commercial/property segment.

A property manager may manage multifamily properties.

The architecture should preserve both concepts rather than collapsing them into one keyword taxonomy.

---

# 5. Audience Hub

The canonical audience hub is:

```text
/for/
```

Visible navigation label:

**Who We Serve**

Purpose:

* organize customer groups
* explain customer-specific needs
* connect audiences to relevant services
* support referral pathways
* create stronger conversion journeys

---

# 6. Canonical Audience Registry

The initial audience model contains **13 strategic audience records**.

| ID                               | Audience                             | Role                                    | Current Page Status |

# 7. Launch Audience Pages

Currently authorized:

```text
/for/home-buyers/
/for/home-sellers/
/for/real-estate-agents/
/for/home-inspectors/
/for/property-managers/
/for/hoa-communities/
```

Count:

```text
6
```

These six provide the initial audience foundation.

---

# 8. Phase 2 Audience Pages

Current Phase 2 opportunities:

```text
/for/homeowners/
/for/real-estate-investors/
/for/landlords/
/for/contractors-remodelers/
/for/facility-managers/
/for/restaurants/
/for/commercial-properties/
```

These should be promoted according to:

* demand
* conversion data
* commercial strategy
* referral opportunity
* search visibility
* content differentiation

---

# 9. Audience Record Model

Recommended machine-readable structure:

```ts
export interface Audience {
  audienceId: string
  name: string
  slug: string
  canonicalUrl: string

  audienceType:
    | 'customer'
    | 'referral_partner'
    | 'professional'
    | 'property_decision_maker'
    | 'commercial_operator'
    | 'organization'

  buildStatus: string
  publicationStatus: string
  indexationStatus: string

  primaryNeeds: string[]
  primaryServices: string[]
  secondaryServices: string[]

  locationMatrixRule:
    | 'full_on_relevant_locations'
    | 'selective'
    | 'commercial_only'
    | 'hold'

  markets: Record<string, string>

  aliases?: string[]
}
```

---

# 10. Audience Matrix Status Model

The audience records below retain historical `Page Status` labels such as `launch` and `phase_2`. Treat those labels as prioritization metadata, not permission to begin or stop development. Before production use, normalize them against the current lifecycle, publication, and indexation fields in `04-master-page-build-list.md`.

Recommended audience-location relationship statuses:

| Status                              | Meaning                                        |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `strong_candidate`                  | Strong audience + geography fit                |
| `phase_2_candidate`                 | Valid post-launch opportunity                  |
| `selective_candidate`               | Requires stronger evidence                     |
| `low_intent_fit`                    | Weak standalone audience search intent         |
| `commercial_fit_only`               | Better handled through commercial architecture |
| `operational_confirmation_required` | Market/service availability not confirmed      |
| `hold_location`                     | Geography should not generate audience pages   |
| `research_only`                     | Retained only for planning                     |

# 11. Audience × Location Mathematical Universe

With:

```text
13 strategic audiences
×
579 geographic records
```

the theoretical audience-location universe would contain:

```text
7,527 relationships
```

This number is useful for opportunity modeling only.

It does **not** mean the website should eventually contain 7,527 audience + location pages.

---

# 12. Audience + Location Canonical Pattern

When selected for production:

```text
/{canonical-location-path}/for/{audience}/
```

Example:

```text
/san-diego-ca/carlsbad/for/home-buyers/
```

Nested example:

```text
/st-louis-mo/st-louis-city/soulard/for/home-buyers/
```

Only relationships selected for production should enter the public route collection. Candidate relationships may generate local or protected-preview routes earlier.

---

# 13. Audience Page Purpose

Audience pages should answer:

> **Why would someone in this particular role use The Sewer Pros?**

They should focus on:

* the decision of the audience
* risk
* workflow
* relevant services
* expected documentation
* next steps
* conversion path

Audience pages should not merely duplicate service pages.

---

# 14. Audience vs Service Intent

Example:

```text
Sewer Camera Inspection
```

answers:

> What is the service?

while:

```text
Home Buyers
```

answers:

> Why should a buyer consider sewer inspection during a property purchase?

These are different search and conversion intents.

---

# 15. Homeowners

**ID:** `aud-homeowners`
**Canonical URL:** `/for/homeowners/`
**Page Status:** `phase_2`

## Primary Needs

* recurring sewer backups
* clogged drains
* sewer-condition questions
* second opinions
* preventative maintenance
* locating unknown sewer lines

## Strong Service Relationships

```text
Sewer Camera Inspection
Sewer Cleaning
Hydro Jetting
Sewer Cleaning + Camera Inspection
Sewer Line Locating
Drain Cleaning
Recurring Sewer Backup Diagnosis
Preventative Sewer Maintenance
Independent Sewer Inspection / Second Opinion
```

## Location Matrix

```text
selective
```

A generic homeowner + location page should not be generated everywhere because the primary local location page may already serve broad homeowner intent.

---

# 16. Home Buyers

**ID:** `aud-home-buyers`
**Canonical URL:** `/for/home-buyers/`
**Page Status:** `launch`

## Primary Needs

* understand underground sewer condition before purchasing
* identify visible defects
* obtain documentation
* reduce unknown financial risk
* understand inspection findings
* obtain independent information

## Primary Services

```text
Pre-Purchase Sewer Inspection
Sewer Camera Inspection
Sewer Cleaning + Camera Inspection
```

## Secondary Services

```text
Sewer Line Locating
Independent Sewer Inspection / Second Opinion
```

## St. Louis-Specific Relationship

```text
Sewer Lateral Inspection & Municipal Reporting
```

where applicable and verified.

## Location Matrix

```text
full_on_relevant_real_estate_locations
```

Home buyers represent one of the strongest audience + location opportunities.

---

# 17. Home Buyer + Location Priority

Strongest candidates should generally be locations with:

* meaningful residential inventory
* active real estate transactions
* established/older housing where relevant
* strong homebuyer search demand
* meaningful referral opportunities

Examples may include:

```text
Carlsbad
Chesterfield
Ballwin
St. Charles
San Marcos
Encinitas
La Jolla
```

but production publication and indexation still require specific evaluation.

---

# 18. Home Sellers

**ID:** `aud-home-sellers`
**Canonical URL:** `/for/home-sellers/`
**Page Status:** `launch`

## Primary Needs

* understand sewer condition before listing

* obtain an independent second opinion

## Primary Services

```text
Sewer Camera Inspection
Pre-Purchase / Transaction Sewer Inspection
Sewer Cleaning + Camera Inspection
Independent Sewer Inspection / Second Opinion
```

## St. Louis-Specific Relationship

```text
Sewer Lateral Inspection & Municipal Reporting
```

where verified.

## Location Matrix

```text
selective
```

Home seller + location pages should be more selective than home buyer pages unless search demand proves otherwise.

---

# 19. Real Estate Agents

**ID:** `aud-real-estate-agents`
**Canonical URL:** `/for/real-estate-agents/`
**Page Status:** `launch`

## Primary Needs

Sewer Camera Inspection
Sewer Cleaning + Camera Inspection
Independent Sewer Inspection / Second Opinion
```

## St. Louis Relationship

```text
Sewer Lateral Inspection & Municipal Reporting
```

where applicable.

## Location Matrix

```text
selective
```

Market-level agent targeting will usually be more useful than producing a separate agent page for every neighborhood.

---

# 20. Home Inspectors

**ID:** `aud-home-inspectors`
**Canonical URL:** `/for/home-inspectors/`
**Page Status:** `launch`

## Primary Needs

* refer underground sewer inspection outside general inspection scope

* understand sewer inspection findings

## Primary Services

```text
Sewer Camera Inspection

```

## Location Matrix

```text
selective
```

Home inspector targeting should generally prioritize:

* market pages
* strong real estate cities
* referral relationships

rather than a full geographic matrix.

---

# 21. Property Managers

**ID:** `aud-property-managers`
**Canonical URL:** `/for/property-managers/`
**Page Status:** `launch`

# 29. Audience-to-Service Relationship Levels

Each audience/service relationship should use one of:

| Value            | Meaning                                     |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `primary`        | Service is highly relevant to this audience |
| `secondary`      | Useful supporting service                   |
| `situational`    | Relevant only in certain circumstances      |
| `not_primary`    | Do not emphasize                            |
| `not_applicable` | Relationship does not apply                 |

This allows structured page planning without pretending every service matters equally to every audience.

---

# 30. Audience-to-Service Core Matrix

# 31. Commercial Architecture

Commercial SEO should function as its own acquisition channel.

Canonical hub:

```text
/commercial/
```

Commercial architecture should answer questions related to:

* property operations
* recurring maintenance
* tenant/customer disruption
* high-use drain systems
* documentation
* scheduling
* commercial property coordination

---

# 32. Canonical Commercial Segments

The initial commercial segment taxonomy contains **8 strategic segments**.

| ID                             | Commercial Segment               | Type                    |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `comseg-restaurants`           | Restaurants & Food Service       | Industry                |
| `comseg-property-management`   | Property Management              | Operating Model         |
| `comseg-multifamily`           | Multifamily Properties           | Property Type           |
| `comseg-hoa`                   | HOA Communities                  | Property / Organization |
| `comseg-hospitality`           | Hotels & Hospitality             | Industry                |
| `comseg-retail`                | Retail Properties                | Property / Industry     |
| `comseg-facilities`            | Facilities / Facility Management | Operating Context       |
| `comseg-commercial-properties` | Commercial Properties            | Umbrella Segment        |

These segments are opportunity-model entities.

They are not all production standalone pages.

# 33. Commercial Segment × Location Universe

If all eight commercial segments were mathematically evaluated against all 579 geographic records:

# 34. Commercial Service Layer

The canonical commercial service registry contains:

```text
Commercial Sewer Camera Inspection
Commercial Sewer Cleaning
Commercial Hydro Jetting
Commercial Drain Cleaning
Commercial Sewer Line Locating
Commercial Preventative Sewer & Drain Maintenance
Commercial Grease & Sludge Removal
```

The commercial matrix therefore operates across two dimensions:

```text
Commercial Segment
↔
Commercial Service
```

and:

```text
Commercial Segment
↔
Location
```

---

# 35. Commercial Service-to-Segment Matrix

| Commercial Segment    | Camera    | Sewer Cleaning | Hydro Jetting | Drain Cleaning | Locating    | Maintenance | Grease / Sludge |
| --------------------- | --------- | -------------- | ------------- | -------------- | ----------- | ----------- | --------------- |
| Restaurants           | Secondary | Primary        | Primary       | Primary        | Situational | Primary     | Primary         |
| Property Management   | Primary   | Primary        | Primary       | Primary        | Secondary   | Primary     | Secondary       |
| Multifamily           | Primary   | Primary        | Primary       | Primary        | Secondary   | Primary     | Situational     |
| HOA Communities       | Primary   | Primary        | Primary       | Primary        | Secondary   | Primary     | Situational     |

# 36. Restaurants & Food Service

**Commercial Segment ID:** `comseg-restaurants`

## Strongest Services

```text
Commercial Hydro Jetting
Commercial Drain Cleaning
Commercial Sewer Cleaning
Commercial Preventative Maintenance
Commercial Grease & Sludge Removal
```

## Supporting Service

```text
Commercial Sewer Camera Inspection
```

## Geographic Priority

Prioritize:

* restaurant districts
* hospitality corridors
* mixed-use districts
* downtown districts
* high-density commercial areas

## Conversion Context

Primary concerns:

* closures
* kitchen disruption
* recurring clogs
* grease/sludge buildup
* customer impact
* maintenance scheduling

---

# 37. Property Management

**Commercial Segment ID:** `comseg-property-management`

Property management is both:

* an audience
* a commercial operating model

## Strongest Services

```text
Commercial Sewer Camera Inspection
Commercial Sewer Cleaning
Commercial Hydro Jetting
Commercial Drain Cleaning
Commercial Preventative Maintenance
```

## Secondary Service

```text
Commercial Sewer Line Locating
```

## Geographic Priority

Prioritize:

* multifamily-heavy locations
* rental-property concentrations
* dense residential markets
* mixed-use areas
* major commercial markets

---

# 38. Multifamily Properties

**Commercial Segment ID:** `comseg-multifamily`

## Strongest Services

```text
Commercial Sewer Camera Inspection
Commercial Sewer Cleaning
Commercial Hydro Jetting
Commercial Drain Cleaning
Commercial Preventative Maintenance
```

## Primary Problems

* repeated building backups
* shared sewer systems
* high usage
* tenant disruption
* recurring drain issues
* scheduled maintenance

## Matrix Rule

```text
selective_high_value
```

Do not automatically create multifamily pages for every residential suburb.

---

# 39. HOA Communities

**Commercial Segment ID:** `comseg-hoa`

This segment overlaps the launch audience:

```text
/for/hoa-communities/
```

The audience page should normally serve the primary HOA entity.

Avoid creating a duplicate:

```text
/commercial/hoa-communities/
```

unless future intent analysis proves a materially separate need.

---

# 40. Hotels & Hospitality

**Commercial Segment ID:** `comseg-hospitality`

## Strongest Services

```text
Commercial Drain Cleaning
Commercial Sewer Cleaning
Commercial Hydro Jetting
Commercial Sewer Camera Inspection
Commercial Preventative Maintenance
```

## Geographic Priority

Hospitality opportunity is particularly relevant to:

```text
Las Vegas Strip
Paradise
Downtown Las Vegas
San Diego hospitality districts
major hotel / tourism corridors
```

Las Vegas is an active operational market. These pages follow the same service-verification, differentiation, publication, and indexation standards used across the site.

---

# 41. Retail Properties

**Commercial Segment ID:** `comseg-retail`

## Primary Services

```text
Commercial Drain Cleaning
Commercial Sewer Cleaning
Commercial Sewer Camera Inspection
Commercial Hydro Jetting
Commercial Preventative Maintenance
```

## Geographic Priority

* shopping districts
* commercial corridors
* downtown areas
* mixed-use districts

---

# 42. Facility Management

**Commercial Segment ID:** `comseg-facilities`

The corresponding human decision-maker is:

```text
Facility Manager
```

## Strongest Services

```text
Commercial Sewer Camera Inspection
Commercial Sewer Cleaning
Commercial Hydro Jetting
Commercial Drain Cleaning
Commercial Sewer Line Locating
Commercial Preventative Maintenance
```

## Core Value

* documentation
* scheduling
* diagnostics
* maintenance
* operational continuity

---

# 43. Commercial Properties

**Commercial Segment ID:** `comseg-commercial-properties`

This is the umbrella commercial segment.

Potential audience page:

```text
/for/commercial-properties/
```

The commercial hub:

```text
/commercial/
```

should remain the broader service-system parent.

Avoid unnecessary overlap between these pages.

---

# 44. Commercial Segment Standalone Page Rule

Do not automatically create:

```text
/commercial/restaurants/
/commercial/hotels/
/commercial/retail/
/commercial/multifamily/
```

simply because a segment exists.

A standalone commercial-segment page requires:

1. distinct search intent
2. meaningful conversion potential
3. differentiated content
4. multiple relevant services
5. low overlap with `/for/` pages
6. deliberate page-build-list production selection

---

# 45. Audience vs Commercial URL Decision

Where the concept represents primarily **who the user is**, prefer:

```text
/for/{audience}/
```

Example:

```text
/for/property-managers/
```

Where the concept represents primarily **what commercial service is needed**, prefer:

```text
/commercial/{service}/
```

Example:

```text
/commercial/hydro-jetting/
```

Avoid creating redundant audience and commercial pages targeting the same intent.

---

# 46. Commercial + Location Pattern

When selected for production:

```text
/{canonical-location-path}/commercial/{service}/
```

Example:

```text
/san-diego-ca/mission-valley/commercial/hydro-jetting/
```

Commercial-service + location architecture is governed jointly by:

* the Service × Location Matrix
* this commercial-fit model
* the Master Page Build List

---

# 47. Audience + Location Pattern

When selected for production:

```text
/{canonical-location-path}/for/{audience}/
```

Example:

```text
/st-louis-mo/chesterfield/for/home-buyers/
```

These pages should remain more selective than service + location pages.

---

# 48. No Full Audience Matrix Publication

Do not generate:

```text
13 audiences
×
579 locations
=
7,527 pages
```

The majority of those relationships would create:

* overlap
* thin pages
* doorway patterns
* poor UX
* little conversion value

Audience-local pages should target unusually strong intersections.

---

# 49. No Full Commercial Matrix Publication

Likewise, do not generate every possible:

```text
Commercial Segment
×
Location
```

or:

```text
Commercial Service
×
Commercial Segment
×
Location
```

combination.

A mathematical cube is useful for research.

It is not a publishing plan.

---

# 50. High-Value Audience + Location Types

The strongest post-launch audience-local opportunities are likely to include:

## Home Buyers + Real Estate Locations

Example:

```text
Home Buyers
+
Carlsbad
```

## Property Managers + Multifamily / Commercial Locations

Example:

```text
Property Managers
+
Mission Valley
```

## Real Estate Agents + Major Markets

Example:

```text
Real Estate Agents
+
St. Louis
```

## HOA Communities + Master-Planned Communities

Example:

```text
HOA Communities
+
Summerlin
```

as a Las Vegas audience-location opportunity.

These remain strategic examples, not automatic production or indexation decisions.

---

# 51. Audience Location Eligibility Factors

Evaluate:

* audience search demand
* local population/property context
* real estate activity
* commercial activity
* referral value
* geographic importance
* service demand
* content differentiation
* conversion potential
* overlap with existing pages

---

# 52. Commercial Location Eligibility Factors

Evaluate:

* commercial property density
* restaurant concentration
* hotel/hospitality concentration
* multifamily
* industrial activity
* property-management presence
* mixed-use development
* service demand
* actual operating coverage

---

# 53. Location Registry Priority Tags

The location registry already provides useful signals such as:

```text
residential
real_estate
property_management
commercial
```

These tags should influence audience/commercial matrix evaluation.

Example:

```text
Location tags:
residential + real_estate
```

may strengthen:

```text
Home Buyers
Home Sellers
Real Estate Agents
Home Inspectors
```

---

# 54. Commercial Tag Influence

A location tagged:

```text
commercial
```

may strengthen:

```text
Property Managers
Facility Managers
Commercial Property Owners
Restaurants
Commercial Services
```

but should not automatically activate every commercial page family.

---

# 55. Audience Matrix Status Logic

Conceptually:

```text
Audience Priority

Location Priority
+
Relevant Location Tags
+

+
Search Intent
+

=
Audience Relationship Status
```

---

# 56. Commercial Matrix Status Logic

Conceptually:

```text
Commercial Segment Fit
+

+
Service Fit
+
Operational Capability
+
Search Intent
+
Conversion Potential
=
Commercial Opportunity Status
```

---

# 57. Recommended Audience Matrix Statuses

```ts
export type AudienceMatrixStatus =
  | 'strong_candidate'
  | 'phase_2_candidate'
  | 'selective_candidate'
  | 'low_intent_fit'
  | 'operational_confirmation_required'
  | 'hold_location'
  | 'research_only'
```

---

# 58. Recommended Commercial Matrix Statuses

```ts
export type CommercialMatrixStatus =
  | 'strong_commercial_candidate'
  | 'phase_2_candidate'
  | 'selective_candidate'
  | 'low_commercial_fit'
  | 'operational_confirmation_required'
  | 'conditional_location'
  | 'hold_location'
  | 'research_only'
```

---

# 59. Audience Relationship Record

Recommended model:

```ts
export interface AudienceLocationRelationship {
  relationshipId: string

  audienceId: string
  locationId: string
  marketId: string

  status: AudienceMatrixStatus

  relevantServiceIds: string[]

  intentFit:
    | 'strong'
    | 'moderate'
    | 'weak'

  conversionFit:
    | 'strong'
    | 'moderate'
    | 'weak'

  candidatePathname: string

  reason: string
}
```

---

# 60. Commercial Relationship Record

Recommended model:

```ts
export interface CommercialLocationRelationship {
  relationshipId: string

  commercialSegmentId: string
  locationId: string
  marketId: string

  status: CommercialMatrixStatus

  relevantCommercialServiceIds: string[]

  commercialFit:
    | 'strong'
    | 'moderate'
    | 'weak'

  candidatePathname?: string

  reason: string
}
```

Not every commercial relationship requires its own pathname.

---

# 61. Audience-to-Service Matrix Should Be Machine-Readable

Recommended file:

```text
/data/matrices/audience-service-matrix.json
```

This should map:

```text
Audience
↔
Service
```

using:

```text
primary
secondary
situational
not_primary
not_applicable
```

---

# 62. Audience-to-Location Matrix

Recommended file:

```text
/data/matrices/audience-location-matrix.json
```

This may model the complete research universe without creating routes.

---

# 63. Commercial Segment-to-Service Matrix

Recommended:

```text
/data/matrices/commercial-segment-service-matrix.json
```

This should define:

```text
Restaurant
→ Hydro Jetting
→ Primary
```

rather than burying these relationships only in page copy.

---

# 64. Commercial Segment-to-Location Matrix

Recommended:

```text
/data/matrices/commercial-location-matrix.json
```

This can identify high-value commercial geographies independently of service + location relationships.

---

# 65. Audience Page Publication Rule

An audience existing in the registry does not mean its page automatically exists in production. Its template, content draft, or candidate route may still be developed.

Example:

```text
aud-homeowners
```

exists strategically.

Current prioritization stage:

```text
phase_2
```

No production route should be generated until the Master Page Build List selects it for publication. This does not prevent development or protected-preview generation.

---

# 66. Audience + Location Publication Rule

A relationship may be mathematically strong.

Example:

```text
Home Buyers
+
Carlsbad
```

But:

```text
/san-diego-ca/carlsbad/for/home-buyers/
```

may exist as a development or protected-preview candidate, but must not enter the production route collection until deliberately selected in the Master Page Build List.

---

# 67. Commercial Publication Rule

A commercial segment may strongly relate to a service and geography.

Example:

```text
Restaurant
+
Mission Valley
+
Commercial Hydro Jetting
```

But publication may be handled through:

```text
/san-diego-ca/mission-valley/commercial/hydro-jetting/
```

rather than creating a separate restaurant-specific route.

The project should choose the smallest set of pages necessary to satisfy distinct intent.

---

# 68. Cannibalization Rule

Before publishing or indexing an audience or commercial page, compare it against:

* canonical service page
* local service page
* commercial service page
* audience hub
* other audience pages
* location page
* market hub
* resource content

Do not publish multiple pages that answer essentially the same query.

---

# 69. Property Manager Cannibalization Example

Potential pages:

```text
/for/property-managers/

/commercial/preventative-maintenance/

/san-diego-ca/mission-valley/commercial/preventative-maintenance/
```

should each have different primary intent.

### `/for/property-managers/`

Focus:

> Why property managers work with The Sewer Pros.

### `/commercial/preventative-maintenance/`

Focus:

> What commercial preventative maintenance service provides.

### Local Commercial Page

Focus:

> Commercial preventative maintenance in a specific verified and selected geography.

---

# 70. Restaurant Cannibalization Example

Potential:

```text
/for/restaurants/
```

and:

```text
/commercial/hydro-jetting/
```

must remain distinct.

### Restaurants Page

Focus:

* food-service operational needs
* drain/sewer risks
* relevant service mix

### Hydro Jetting Page

Focus:

* hydro-jetting service
* process
* use cases
* commercial applications

---

# 71. Homebuyer Cannibalization Example

Potential:

```text
/for/home-buyers/
```

and:

```text
/services/pre-purchase-sewer-inspection/
```

should remain separate.

### Home Buyers

Focus on:

* purchase process
* hidden sewer risk
* transaction decisions
* inspection coordination

### Pre-Purchase Sewer Inspection

Focus on:

* service
* inspection process
* findings
* documentation
* when to schedule

---

# 72. St. Louis Real Estate Opportunity

St. Louis has additional audience opportunity around:

```text
Sewer Lateral Inspection
Municipal Reporting
Home Buyers
Home Sellers
Real Estate Agents
Home Inspectors
```

However:

> municipal claims must remain program-specific and verified.

Do not use a broad St. Louis claim to automatically generate municipality-specific program pages.

---

# 73. San Diego Audience Opportunity

Priority San Diego audience relationships include:

* home buyers
* real estate agents
* home inspectors
* property managers
* commercial property owners

North County may provide especially strong real-estate audience opportunities.

Audience-local expansion should remain data-driven.

---

# 74. Las Vegas Audience Opportunity

Las Vegas is a confirmed operational market.

Audience relationships, templates, content, routes, and production pages may be developed under the same build-first model used for St. Louis and San Diego. There is no separate Las Vegas approval or operational gate.

Page-specific service claims and geographic statements must still remain accurate, but ordinary development, publication planning, and indexation evaluation may proceed without waiting for additional market confirmation.

---

# 75. Las Vegas Commercial Opportunity

Las Vegas presents substantial commercial opportunities around:

```text
Restaurants
Hotels
Hospitality
Retail
Property Management
Facilities
Commercial Properties
```

Priority geographies may include:

```text
Las Vegas Strip
Paradise
Downtown Las Vegas
Henderson
North Las Vegas
commercial corridors
industrial districts
```

These are research priorities, not automatic production publication or indexation decisions.

---

# 76. Commercial Packaging Validation

Some commercial services extend proven technical capabilities into dedicated commercial messaging.

Therefore, distinguish:

```text
Technical Capability Confirmed
```

from:

```text
Every Commercial Offer Detail Confirmed
```

Do not invent:

* service contracts
* emergency response times
* after-hours availability
* annual maintenance frequency
* account management systems
* equipment capacity
* multi-property pricing
* guaranteed response windows

---

# 77. Audience Messaging Principle

Audience pages should speak to:

```text
Audience Problem
↓
Decision
↓
Relevant Service
↓
Evidence
↓
Outcome
↓
CTA
```

not:

```text
Audience Keyword
↓
Generic Service Copy
```

---

# 78. Commercial Messaging Principle

Commercial pages should emphasize:

* operational continuity
* recurring maintenance
* documentation
* scheduling
* property coordination
* disruption reduction
* high-use systems
* multi-unit or business environments

Commercial pages should not be residential pages with the word "commercial" inserted.

---

---

# 84. Internal Linking — Audience Pages

Audience pages should generally link to:

* primary relevant services
* selected secondary services
* primary markets
* relevant commercial pages
* relevant resources
* CTA

They should not link to every service merely for SEO.

---

# 85. Service-to-Audience Linking

Canonical service pages may link to highly relevant audience pages.

Example:

```text
Pre-Purchase Sewer Inspection
→ Home Buyers
→ Home Sellers
→ Real Estate Agents
```

---

# 86. Commercial Service-to-Audience Linking

Example:

```text
Commercial Hydro Jetting
→ Property Managers
→ Restaurants
→ Facility Managers
```

when those pages exist.

---

# 87. Location-to-Audience Linking

A location page may surface high-value audiences relevant to that geography.

Example:

```text
Carlsbad
→ Home Buyers
```

only when that link supports a real user pathway.

Avoid turning every location page into a directory of all audience permutations.

---

# 88. Audience-to-Location Linking

A global audience page should emphasize:

* three primary markets
* selected priority locations

rather than listing all 579 geographic records.

---

# 89. Commercial-to-Location Linking

Commercial pages should highlight:

* strongest commercial markets
* selected commercially relevant locations

Do not display hundreds of city/neighborhood links.

---

# 90. Audience SEO Intent

Audience keyword research should include patterns such as:

```text
sewer inspection for home buyers
sewer inspection for real estate agents
sewer services for property managers
sewer inspection for home inspectors
sewer services for HOAs
```

Keyword findings should map to canonical audiences rather than automatically generating variants.

---

# 91. Commercial SEO Intent

Commercial research may include:

```text
commercial sewer inspection
commercial hydro jetting
restaurant drain cleaning
property management sewer service
multifamily sewer maintenance
commercial drain maintenance
```

The project should determine whether these map best to:

* commercial service pages
* audience pages
* commercial segment pages
* local commercial pages
* resources

before selecting production routes. Candidate routes may be created earlier for development and review.

---

# 92. Audience Alias Rule

Potential aliases should map to canonical audiences.

Example:

```text
Realtors
Real Estate Professionals
Listing Agents
Buyer Agents
```

may map primarily to:

```text
Real Estate Agents
```

Do not create four audience pages solely for vocabulary variants.

---

# 93. Commercial Alias Rule

Examples:

```text
Apartment Communities
Apartment Buildings
Multifamily Buildings
```

may map into:

```text
Multifamily Properties
```

unless future search intent supports distinct segmentation.

---

# 94. Role vs Property-Type Rule

Do not confuse:

```text
Property Manager
```

with:

```text
Multifamily Property
```

The first describes a decision-maker.

The second describes a property type.

This distinction supports more accurate messaging and analytics.

---

# 95. Audience Page Expansion Order

Recommended default order after launch:

```text
1. Homeowners
2. Real Estate Investors
3. Landlords
4. Facility Managers
5. Restaurants
6. Commercial Property Owners
7. Contractors / Remodelers
```

Actual priority should respond to:

* lead data
* referral opportunities
* Search Console
* commercial demand
* business priorities

---

# 96. Audience + Location Expansion Order

Recommended:

```text
1. Home Buyers + strongest real estate locations
2. Property Managers + strong property-management locations
3. Real Estate Agents + major markets
4. HOA Communities + strong HOA/master-planned markets
5. Investors + selected investment markets
6. Facility Managers + commercial districts
```

---

# 97. Commercial Expansion Order

Recommended:

```text
1. Commercial service pages
2. High-value commercial + location pages
3. Restaurant / food-service audience
4. Facility-manager audience
5. Commercial-property-owner audience
6. Multifamily opportunities
7. Hospitality opportunities
8. Retail opportunities
9. More specialized commercial segments
```

---

# 98. Current Launch Commercial Services

Current production selection:

```text
/commercial/sewer-camera-inspection/
/commercial/sewer-cleaning/
/commercial/hydro-jetting/
/commercial/drain-cleaning/
/commercial/preventative-maintenance/
```

These should establish commercial topical authority before large-scale commercial-location expansion.

---

# 99. Phase 2 Commercial Services

Current Phase 2:

```text
/commercial/sewer-line-locating/
/commercial/grease-sludge-removal/
```

These remain narrower opportunities.

---

# 100. Initial Audience + Location Launch Rule

Current launch:

```text
0 audience + location pages
```

This is intentional.

The site should establish:

* canonical audiences
* canonical services
* market hubs
* location hubs

before expanding audience-local combinations.

---

# 101. Initial Commercial + Location Launch Rule

Current launch:

```text
0 commercial + location pages
```

This is intentional.

Commercial-local expansion begins after:

* core commercial pages exist
* market/location architecture exists
* local commercial demand can be prioritized

---

# 102. Post-Launch Data Signals

Audience and commercial page promotion should increasingly respond to:

* Search Console impressions
* organic queries
* CRM lead source
* lead type
* service requested
* property type
* customer role
* referral source
* market
* call tracking
* conversion rate
* sales value

---

# 103. CRM Data Opportunity

Future lead forms should ideally capture enough structured information to identify:

```text
Customer Type
Property Type
Service Needed
Market
Location
```

This can reveal opportunities such as:

```text
High volume of property-manager leads
+
Mission Valley
+
Hydro Jetting
```

which may justify a new local commercial page.

---

# 104. Audience Analytics

Analytics should eventually allow reporting by:

```text
Audience Page Family
```

Examples:

* homebuyer leads
* agent referrals
* property-manager leads
* HOA inquiries
* commercial-owner leads

This helps determine which audience architecture is producing business value.

---

# 105. Commercial Analytics

Commercial reporting should distinguish:

* service
* market
* location
* commercial segment
* lead value
* conversion

A lower-traffic commercial page may still be strategically valuable if it produces higher-value leads.

# 107. Audience Page Production Readiness

Before publishing an audience page, verify:

* distinct audience intent
* real relevant services
* meaningful customer problem
* distinct copy
* relevant FAQs
* useful internal links
* appropriate CTA
* no fabricated audience-specific claims

---

# 108. Audience + Location Production Readiness

Require:

* strong audience/location relevance
* unique geographic information
* legitimate service availability
* audience-specific local problem/decision context
* no duplicate city swapping
* useful internal links
* conversion value

---

# 109. Commercial Page Production Readiness

Require:

* verified commercial capability
* clear business-use intent
* real relevant services
* commercial-specific concerns
* no fabricated equipment or response claims
* meaningful CTA

---

# 110. Commercial + Location Production Readiness

Require:

* strong commercial geographic fit
* verified operational coverage
* relevant commercial service
* local commercial context
* differentiated content
* adequate search or conversion opportunity

---

# 111. No Keyword-Swap Publishing

Do not create:

```text
Sewer Services for Property Managers in Carlsbad
Sewer Services for Property Managers in Oceanside
Sewer Services for Property Managers in Encinitas
```

from one template with only the city changed.

Audience + location pages require legitimate differentiation.

---

# 112. No Industry-Swap Publishing

Likewise, do not create:

```text
Restaurant Sewer Services
Hotel Sewer Services
Retail Sewer Services
Office Sewer Services
Warehouse Sewer Services
```

from identical content with only the business type replaced.

Industry pages require meaningful:

* operational differences
* service differences
* problem differences
* conversion differences

---

# 113. No Fake Local Commercial Presence

A local commercial landing page must not imply:

* a local office
* dedicated local commercial division
* local staff base
* separate GBP

unless those facts are true.

It represents service-area targeting.

---

# 114. Schema Rule

Schema should describe actual page entities.

Audience pages do not need invented business entities for each customer group.

Commercial-local pages must not fabricate separate LocalBusiness locations.

Structured data strategy will be defined in:

# 115. Matrix and AI Search

The audience/commercial relationship system should help AI systems understand statements such as:

```text
The Sewer Pros provides pre-purchase sewer inspections for home buyers.
```

```text
The Sewer Pros provides commercial hydro jetting for restaurants and property managers.
```

```text
The Sewer Pros provides sewer inspection and cleaning services in verified markets selected for publication.
```

These relationships should be:

* consistent
* factual
* reinforced across pages
* supported by internal links

---

# 116. Matrix and Topical Authority

Audience architecture expands topical authority beyond service keywords.

Example cluster:

```text
Home Buying
├── Home Buyers
├── Pre-Purchase Sewer Inspection
├── Sewer Camera Inspection
├── Inspection Reports
├── Common Inspection Findings
└── Relevant Local Pages
```

Commercial example:

```text
Property Management
├── Property Managers
├── Commercial Sewer Cleaning
├── Commercial Hydro Jetting
├── Preventative Maintenance
├── Recurring Backup Resources
└── Relevant Commercial Locations
```

---

# 117. Matrix and AEO

Audience pages should answer role-specific questions directly.

Examples:

```text
Should a home buyer get a sewer inspection?
```

```text
When should a property manager schedule hydro jetting?
```

```text
What does a real estate agent need from a sewer inspection report?
```

These questions can support:

* PAA
* featured snippets
* voice search
* AI retrieval

without creating separate pages for every question.

---

# 118. Machine-Readable Files

Recommended future data architecture:

```text
/data/audiences/master-audience-registry.json

/data/commercial/master-commercial-segment-registry.json

/data/matrices/audience-service-matrix.json

/data/matrices/audience-location-matrix.json

/data/matrices/commercial-segment-service-matrix.json

/data/matrices/commercial-location-matrix.json
```

---

# 119. Full Mathematical Matrices Are Research Data

If the complete matrices are generated:

```text
Audience × Location:
13 × 579 = 7,527
```

```text
Commercial Segment × Location:
8 × 579 = 4,632
```

these should remain:

```text
Research Opportunity Data
```

rather than:

```text
Route Manifests
```

---

# 120. Do Not Feed Full Matrices to `generateStaticParams()`

Prohibited:

```ts
audiences.flatMap((audience) =>
  locations.map((location) => ({
    audience,
    location,
  }))
)
```

for production routing.

Likewise prohibited:

```ts
commercialSegments.flatMap((segment) =>
  locations.map((location) => ({
    segment,
    location,
  }))
)
```

---

# 121. Correct Route Generation

Production routes should derive from:

```text
04-master-page-build-list.md
```

Example:

```ts
const publishedAudiencePages =
  pageRegistry.filter(
    (page) =>
      page.publicationStatus === 'published' &&
      (page.pageType === 'audience' ||
        page.pageType === 'audience-location')
  )
```

Commercial pages follow the same principle.

---

# 122. Audience Relationship IDs

Recommended:

```text
{audienceId}::{locationId}
```

Example:

```text
aud-home-buyers::loc-sd-carlsbad
```

---

# 123. Commercial Relationship IDs

Recommended:

```text
{commercialSegmentId}::{locationId}
```

Example:

```text
comseg-restaurants::loc-sd-mission-valley
```

Commercial service relationships can reference separate service IDs.

---

# 124. Business Reality Override

No matrix relationship may override:

* actual service capability
* actual service area
* commercial capacity
* business model
* legal requirements
* brand positioning

An SEO opportunity can be rejected because the business should not make the claim.

---

# 125. Sewer Repair Boundary

Audience and commercial content must not drift into selling:

```text
Sewer Repair
Sewer Replacement
Trenchless Repair
Pipe Lining
Pipe Bursting
```

unless the operating model changes.

These topics may appear in educational or second-opinion contexts.

---

# 126. Independent Inspection Positioning

Several audiences strongly benefit from the independent-inspection differentiator:

```text
Home Buyers
Home Sellers
Real Estate Agents
Home Inspectors
Investors
Property Managers
Commercial Property Owners
```

Messaging may emphasize:

* evidence
* inspection
* documentation
* informed decisions
* absence of repair-driven sales incentive

without attacking competitors.

---

# 127. Evidence-First Audience Messaging

Preferred framework:

```text
Audience Situation
↓
Question / Risk
↓
Inspection or Service
↓
Evidence
↓
Decision
```

This should be especially strong for:

* home buyers
* sellers
* agents
* inspectors
* investors
* property managers

---

# 128. Commercial Proof Requirements

Commercial content should increasingly incorporate verified proof such as:

* actual commercial project experience
* property types served
* service documentation
* case studies
* recurring-client relationships
* reviews
* service photos

Do not fabricate proof to make a page appear commercially established.

---

# 129. Future Commercial Segments

Potential future segments may include:

```text
Office Buildings
Industrial Properties
Warehouses
Healthcare Facilities
Schools
Municipal Facilities
Senior Living
Shopping Centers
Mixed-Use Developments
```

These are **research opportunities**, not verified canonical segments or production pages.

They should be added only when business demand and service fit justify them.

---

# 130. Future Audience Segments

Potential future audiences may include:

```text
Developers
General Contractors
HOA Board Members
Real Estate Brokers
Municipal Property Managers
Maintenance Supervisors
Asset Managers
```

Do not add them merely to increase page count.

---

# 131. Audience Consolidation Rule

If two audiences share essentially the same:

* intent
* service needs
* messaging
* conversion path

they should normally be consolidated.

Example:

```text
Realtors
```

does not need to exist separately from:

```text
Real Estate Agents
```

solely for a keyword variant.

---

# 132. Commercial Consolidation Rule

Likewise:

```text
Apartment Buildings
Apartment Communities
Multifamily Communities
```

may remain one canonical:

```text
Multifamily Properties
```

entity until meaningful search or service differences justify subdivision.

---

# 133. Audience Removal Workflow

If an audience page is retired:

```text
Evaluate Traffic
↓
Evaluate Leads
↓
Choose Relevant Destination
↓
Redirect if Appropriate
↓
Update Internal Links
↓
Update Registry
↓
Update Sitemap
```

Do not simply delete established URLs.

---

# 134. Commercial Segment Removal Workflow

A commercial segment may remain in research data even if its standalone page is retired.

Again:

```text
Entity Relationship
≠
Page Requirement
```

---

# 135. Site OS Governance

Site OS Master governs reusable:

* research workflows
* page evaluation
* content workflows
* QA
* publishing
* optimization

This project document governs:

* canonical audience definitions
* commercial segment definitions
* audience-service fit
* audience-location fit
* commercial-service fit
* commercial-location fit
* project-specific publishing guardrails

---

# 136. `CLAUDE.md` Audience/Commercial Rule

`CLAUDE.md` should eventually state:

Audience and commercial matrices are opportunity models, not production route manifests. They may support candidate routes, templates, drafts, and protected previews. Never place an audience + location or commercial + location route into production publication or indexation unless its lifecycle state in `04-master-page-build-list.md` allows it.

---

# 137. Critical Audience Rules

### Rule 1

Audience pages must represent distinct customer or referral intent.

### Rule 2

Keyword variants do not create new audiences.

### Rule 3

Audience pages should focus on audience decisions rather than duplicate service pages.

### Rule 4

Home buyers are a primary strategic audience.

### Rule 5

Real estate agents and home inspectors are important referral audiences.

### Rule 6

Property managers represent both audience and commercial acquisition opportunity.

### Rule 7

Audience + location production publication is post-launch by default unless the Master Page Build List states otherwise. Development may begin earlier.

### Rule 8

Do not mass-publish the theoretical 7,527 audience-location combinations.

### Rule 9

Las Vegas audience-local pages may be built, published, and indexed under the same quality and business-truth standards as the other active markets.

---

# 138. Critical Commercial Rules

### Rule 1

Commercial is a dedicated acquisition channel.

### Rule 2

Commercial services must use real confirmed capabilities.

### Rule 3

Commercial pages must not duplicate residential copy.

### Rule 4

Commercial geography requires real commercial fit.

### Rule 5

Commercial + location production publication is post-launch by default unless the Master Page Build List states otherwise. Development may begin earlier.

### Rule 6

Do not mass-publish commercial-segment matrices.

### Rule 7

Restaurants are strongly connected to hydro jetting, drain cleaning, sewer cleaning, and preventative maintenance.

### Rule 8

Grease/sludge removal does not automatically mean grease-trap cleaning.

### Rule 9

Property managers, facility managers, and commercial property owners are high-value decision-maker audiences.

### Rule 10

Hotels, hospitality, and other Las Vegas commercial opportunities may proceed under the standard build-first, publication, and indexation model.

---

# 139. Production Publication and Indexation Authority

The following are never sufficient by themselves to publish or index a page:

```text
Audience Exists
Commercial Segment Exists
Audience-Service Relationship Exists
Audience-Location Relationship Exists
Commercial-Service Relationship Exists
Commercial-Location Relationship Exists
Search Volume Exists
Claude Suggests Page
Competitor Has Page
```

A production page requires a publication state in:

```text
04-master-page-build-list.md
```

An indexable page additionally requires the appropriate indexation state. Neither requirement prevents research, drafting, template creation, candidate-route generation, or protected-preview QA.

---

# 140. Final Audience & Commercial Principle

The Sewer Pros should use audience and commercial architecture to move beyond generic service SEO and address **why different customers need sewer expertise**.

The audience model is:

```text
Customer Role
↓
Customer Problem
↓
Relevant Service
↓
Evidence / Documentation
↓
Decision
↓
Conversion
```

The commercial model is:

```text
Commercial Environment
↓
Operational Risk
↓
Relevant Commercial Service
↓
Relevant Geography
↓
Maintenance / Diagnostic Need
↓
Conversion
```

The opportunity universe may eventually contain thousands of mathematically valid relationships.

The website should publish only those with:

```text
Distinct Intent
+
Real Business Value
+
Verified Capability
+
Geographic Relevance
+
Useful Content
+
Master Page Publication and Indexation State
```

The governing principle is:

```text
Model Audiences Broadly
Model Commercial Opportunity Deeply
Publish Selectively
Measure Results
Expand From Evidence
```

**The audience and commercial matrices model who the company can serve and where opportunity exists.
The Master Page Build List controls which relationships become production pages and whether those pages are indexable; it does not prevent promising relationships from being researched, drafted, built, or reviewed.**
