# Master Service Registry

**Project:** The Sewer Pros multi-market website rebuild  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Markets:** St. Louis, MO · San Diego, CA · Las Vegas, NV

## Purpose

This registry is the normalized service source of truth for global service pages and all downstream service + location and commercial + location matrices. It separates **established services** from **derived use-case services**, **commercial packaging**, and **market-specific capabilities** so the rebuild can expand topical coverage without falsely implying that every proposed page is an identical current offering in every market.

## Canonical URL rules

```text
/services/
/services/{service}/
/commercial/
/commercial/{service}/
/{market}/{location}/{service}/
/{market}/{location}/commercial/{service}/
/st-louis-mo/{market-specific-service}/
```

**Hard rule:** do not use flat matrix slugs such as `/san-diego-ca/sewer-camera-inspection-carlsbad/` or `/st-louis-mo/commercial-hydro-jetting-chesterfield/`.

## Service status model

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `established_existing_service` | Explicit standalone service on the current public sites |
| `existing_use_case_promoted_to_standalone_page` | Existing service use case that deserves a separate intent page in the rebuild |
| `existing_maintenance_use_case_promoted_to_standalone_page` | Existing maintenance positioning expanded into a dedicated service page |
| `existing_brand_differentiator_promoted_to_standalone_page` | Existing positioning turned into a distinct high-intent conversion page |
| `commercial_expansion_from_confirmed_core_capability` | Core capability is proven; standalone commercial packaging must be validated |
| `explicit_existing_commercial_use_case` | Current public content explicitly supports commercial use |
| `market_specific_existing_capability` | Confirmed capability that belongs to one market only |

## Registry summary

- **18 service records**
- **2 service hubs**
- **6 core services**
- **4 derived/high-intent services**
- **7 commercial services**
- **1 market-specific service**

## Alias, overlap, and exclusion guardrails

| Term | Disposition | Canonical target | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|
| Sewer Scope | `alias_only` | `svc-sewer-camera-inspection` | Same underlying customer intent/technique as sewer camera inspection. |
| Rooter Service | `alias_only` | `svc-sewer-cleaning` | Treat as search terminology for sewer cleaning unless a distinct operational offering is confirmed. |
| Root Intrusion Removal | `problem_or_subservice_not_standalone_at_launch` | `svc-sewer-cleaning` | Existing cleaning service removes roots; avoid intent fragmentation until demand supports a separate page. |
| Grease Trap Cleaning | `hold_pending_service_confirmation` | — | Current hydro-jetting content recommends maintenance programs that include grease-trap cleaning, but does not clearly establish that The Sewer Pros performs grease-trap cleaning. |
| Sewer Repair | `not_offered` | — | Brand positioning explicitly distinguishes The Sewer Pros from repair companies. |
| Sewer Line Replacement | `not_offered` | — | Use as educational/comparison intent, not a service. |
| Trenchless Sewer Repair | `not_offered` | — | Not supported by the current service model. |
| Pipe Bursting / Pipe Lining | `not_offered` | — | Not supported by the current service model. |
| General Plumbing | `do_not_expand_without_confirmation` | — | The brand is positioned as a sewer inspection, cleaning, locating, and maintenance specialist rather than a broad plumbing contractor. |

## Matrix generation rules

1. **Core services** are the default service + location matrix set, subject to the location registry's own eligibility/status.
2. **Pre-purchase sewer inspection** is matrix-eligible primarily for residential and real-estate-priority geographies.
3. **Recurring sewer backup diagnosis** is matrix-eligible where homeowner, landlord, property-management, or commercial recurring-problem intent is strong.
4. **Preventative sewer maintenance** and **independent second-opinion inspection** are selective expansion services, not automatic full-matrix launch pages.
5. **Commercial services** generate pages only against locations tagged as commercially eligible in the Master Location Registry.
6. **St. Louis sewer lateral inspection/reporting** is St. Louis-only and should never be generated into San Diego or Las Vegas.
7. A service-location relationship may exist in the mathematical registry without being published or indexable. Publication requires operational availability and enough differentiated content.

## Critical service-boundary rules

- Do not add sewer repair, sewer replacement, trenchless repair, pipe lining, or pipe bursting as offered services unless the company changes its operating model.
- Preserve the brand differentiator that inspection recommendations are independent of a repair sale.
- Do not claim grease-trap cleaning unless separately confirmed.
- Do not turn every problem keyword (roots, sags, offsets, bellies, cracked pipe, slow drains) into a service. Most belong in the problem/resource taxonomy and should link back to the appropriate service.
- Las Vegas service availability must be confirmed before customer-facing pages claim a specific service is offered there.

## Source support used to normalize the registry

- Current St. Louis and San Diego sites both list the same six core specialties: sewer camera inspection, sewer cleaning, hydro jetting, sewer cleaning + camera inspection, line locating, and drain cleaning.
- Current sewer-camera content promotes pre-purchase inspection, condition reporting, and buyer/agent use cases.
- Current cleaning + camera content explicitly supports recurring-backup diagnosis and independent third-party evaluation.
- Current hydro-jetting content explicitly supports grease/sludge removal, commercial properties/food establishments, and scheduled preventative maintenance.
- Current St. Louis homepage states the company is licensed through most municipal sewer lateral programs for submitting reports.

## Recommended source-of-truth usage

`master-service-registry.json` should drive programmatic page-registry generation. This Markdown file is the human-readable planning and review layer.
