/**
 * The Organization entity.
 *
 * Authority: docs/15-schema-entity-strategy.md §4-13, §21-22, §26-27,
 *            §61, §63-65, §69-80, §102-103, §111
 *            docs/22-decisions-change-log.md DEC-072, DEC-078
 *
 * Build sequence step 15, unblocked by DEC-078.
 *
 * ===========================================================================
 * ONE ORGANIZATION, NO LocalBusiness, NO ADDRESS — PERMANENTLY
 * ===========================================================================
 * 15 §4 and §111: one company entity across all three markets. Markets
 * are not separate businesses and must never be modelled as such.
 *
 * DEC-072 settled the address question structurally rather than
 * temporarily. There is no physical address anywhere — service is
 * delivered at the customer's location under a Service-Area-Business
 * model. So:
 *
 *   - `permitsLocalBusinessEntity()` returns false for every market,
 *     and will keep returning false
 *   - no `LocalBusiness` node is emitted anywhere on the site
 *   - no `PostalAddress` node exists in the codebase
 *   - coverage is expressed as `Service` + `areaServed` + `Place`
 *     (15 §13, §22)
 *
 * This is not caution pending verification. It is the correct model for
 * how the business actually operates.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHAT IS ABSENT, AND WHY EACH ABSENCE IS DELIBERATE
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * `address`          — none exists (DEC-072)
 * `aggregateRating`  — 15 §61, DEC-028. Verified rating data DOES now
 *                      exist (4.9 from 595 reviews, DEC-085), but that
 *                      decision approves it as VISIBLE TEXT only and
 *                      restates DEC-028 as remaining in force. The
 *                      absence is not pending better data: self-serving
 *                      ratings on Organization/LocalBusiness are
 *                      ineligible for Google review-snippet stars
 * `sameAs`           — 15 §26-27. 01 §22 records San Diego social
 *                      presence but supplies no URLs, and a profile must
 *                      be verified as official and controlled first
 * `logo` / `image`   — no approved asset
 * `foundingDate`     — St. Louis 2011 and San Diego 2015 are per-market
 *                      facts (DEC-070, DEC-071). The ORGANISATION has no
 *                      single founding year, and 01 §20 forbids electing
 *                      one market's as the company's
 * `priceRange`       — never documented; 15 §103 names it explicitly
 *
 * 15 §103: "A smaller accurate schema object is preferable to a larger
 * inaccurate one."
