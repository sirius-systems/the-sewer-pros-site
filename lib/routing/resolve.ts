 * RESOLVE BY REGISTRY LOOKUP, NEVER BY INFERENCE
 * ===========================================================================
 * 05 §69: a three-segment market path is ambiguous by shape alone —
 *
 *   /st-louis-mo/st-louis-city/soulard/                  nested geography
 *   /st-louis-mo/st-louis-city/sewer-camera-inspection/  service + location
 *
 * "The system must resolve page identity using the approved pathname
 * registry rather than trying to infer meaning from segment count
 * alone." So nothing here parses meaning out of segments. It joins them
 * into a pathname and asks the registry.
 *
 * 05 §130 forbids runtime route invention; 05 §77 requires unknown paths
 * to 404 rather than fall back to a market, redirect home, or render a
 * thin generic template.
