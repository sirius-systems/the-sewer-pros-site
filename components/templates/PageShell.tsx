/**
 * Shared page shell.
 *
 * Governed by docs/18-design-system.md §108, §155, Appendix A, Appendix B;
 * docs/05-url-routing-strategy.md §82.
 *
 * Provides the two things every template needs regardless of family:
 * the breadcrumb trail, and a density-rhythm check over the sections
 * the template actually composed.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE RHYTHM CHECK RUNS AT BUILD, NOT IN REVIEW
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 18 Appendix B is explicitly a judgement review of the RENDERED page,
 * run "after Claude Code has built the page, not as an automated
 * pre-build gate", because most of its checks are design judgements.
 *
 * Density is the exception. Whether a page varies its density is a
 * mechanical fact about the sequence, so it is checked here — and
 * reported as a build warning rather than an error, matching Appendix
 * B's instruction to present findings "as fixes to make, not a score".
 *
 * Templates pass the densities they composed. That list is written by
 * hand rather than inferred, which is deliberate: it makes the page's
 * intended rhythm explicit and reviewable in the template source.
