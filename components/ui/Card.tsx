/**
 * Card shell.
 *
 * Governed by docs/18-design-system.md §5.6, §23-25, §50, §155 and
 * Appendix A.
 *
 * ===========================================================================
 * ⚠ READ §5.6 BEFORE REACHING FOR THIS
 * ===========================================================================
 * "Cards are an organizational tool, not the default layout. A page
 * built entirely from card grids is the single strongest visual signal
 * of a templated or AI-generated site, regardless of how restrained the
 * individual card styling is."
 *
 * Before putting a section in a card grid, check whether one of
 * Appendix A's other patterns fits the content's actual shape:
 *
 *   editorial split   one clear idea beside an image
 *   editorial stack   plain text, no card chrome at all
 *   service index     a scannable list — the right choice when the
 *                     item count does not divide evenly
 *   service mosaic    uneven grid giving the flagship item more space
 *   image break       full-width image between dense sections
 *
 * 18 §155 names two card failures explicitly: using a card grid as the
 * default for every list-like section, and forcing an item count into a
 * grid it does not divide into evenly. `CardGrid` below refuses to
 * silently do the second.
 *
 * Styling follows §23 (restrained radius, no pills), §24 (subtle
 * borders) and §25 (no dramatic floating cards — border, not shadow).
