/**
 * Market coverage.
 *
 * Governed by docs/18-design-system.md §52, §86, §87, §134-136;
 * docs/15-schema-entity-strategy.md §11-13;
 * docs/01-business-brand-foundation.md §20-21;
 * CLAUDE.md §29, §30, §135.
 *
 * ===========================================================================
 * SERVICE MARKETS, NOT OFFICES
 * ===========================================================================
 * 18 §87 requires the distinction be "visually explicit": a market map
 * or list communicates "Areas We Serve", never "Our Offices".
 *
 * 18 §135 forbids UI cards reading "San Diego Office" or "Las Vegas
 * Office" with map pins or stock addresses. 18 §86 forbids map pins
 * implying offices where none are verified. No market currently
 * permits a `LocalBusiness` entity — verified when the market registry
 * was built — so this section renders no address, no pin, and no
 * office language at all.
 *
 * The heading default is therefore "Where we work", and callers should
 * keep any override in service-area terms.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * GATED MARKETS DISAPPEAR
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Markets are sourced from approved `market` pages and filtered to
 * indexable ones (04 §4), so Las Vegas is absent until PENDING-012
 * resolves — the same rule the header and footer follow. It returns
 * automatically once doc 04 promotes those records.

/**

 * passes or sees.
 *
 * A template listing this section in its `densities` array must gate
 * that entry on this predicate. An array entry for a section that
 * omitted itself describes a page that was never built, and
 * `sectionRhythmIssues()` then checks the fiction instead of the page.
 *
 * Exported rather than restated at each call site so the array and the
 * render read one condition, not two copies of it.
