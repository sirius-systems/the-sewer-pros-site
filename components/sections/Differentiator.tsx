/**
 * Independent-model differentiator.
 *
 * Governed by docs/18-design-system.md §64, §141, §5.6;
 * docs/01-business-brand-foundation.md §4, §72;
 * CLAUDE.md §32, §72.
 *
 * ===========================================================================
 * THE TONE CONSTRAINT IS THE POINT OF THIS SECTION
 * ===========================================================================
 * 18 §64: "Keep the presentation factual and non-accusatory."
 * 01 §72 and CLAUDE.md §32: do not claim competitors are dishonest or
 * that they recommend unnecessary work.
 *
 * So the contrast is between BUSINESS MODELS, not integrity. Saying a
 * contractor who sells repairs earns from repairs is a description of
 * an incentive structure; saying they exploit it is an accusation. The
 * copy lives in `differentiatorContrast`, where that framing is fixed
 * and reviewable, rather than being passed in per page where it could
 * drift into a sharper claim.
 *
 * Pattern is Appendix A's "editorial split" — one clear idea, two
 * columns, no cards. Neither column is styled as a winner: 18 §66
 * forbids manipulating visual emphasis to misrepresent alternatives,
 * and while that rule addresses comparison pages, the same honesty
 * applies here.
