/**
 * Breadcrumb trail.
 *
 * Governed by docs/05-url-routing-strategy.md §82, §118;
 * docs/03-information-architecture.md §53;
 * docs/16-internal-linking-strategy.md §25;
 * docs/15-schema-entity-strategy.md §54-55.
 *
 * ===========================================================================
 * ⚠ AN UNRESOLVED DOCUMENT CONFLICT IS VISIBLE HERE
 * ===========================================================================
 * The trail is built by walking `parentId` through the approved page
 * registry, which encodes 03 §53's hierarchy:
 *
 *   Market → Parent → Markets Hub
 *   Location → Parent → Market
 *
 * That produces, for a service + location page:
 *
 *   Home > Locations > San Diego > Mission Valley > Hydro Jetting
 *
 * But 05 §118's worked example shows:
 *
 *   Home → San Diego Market → Carlsbad → Sewer Camera Inspection
 *
 * without the Locations hub. Both cannot be right for rendered
 * breadcrumbs.
 *
 * This follows 03 §53 because that section states parentage as a rule
 * for every page family, while 05 §118's trail is an illustration
 * inside a section about resolving parents from entities rather than
 * strings — the point it actually argues is the one both agree on.
 * Following the registry also keeps the rendered trail identical to the
 * validated `parentId` graph, so breadcrumbs cannot drift from the data
 * that route generation uses.
 *
 * ⚠ Resolve before step 15. `BreadcrumbList` schema must match the
 * visible trail (15 §67, §54), so whichever shape is chosen gets baked
 * into structured data too.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Every item is an approved page — validation guarantees parents
 * resolve — so a trail can never link to a route that does not exist
 * (05 §117, 16 §25). The current page is rendered as text, not a link.
